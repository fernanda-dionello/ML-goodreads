review_text
"I read this delightfully smutty book in a few hours and really enjoyed it. Yes the plot is a little far-fetched but the characters are engaging and the sexy times are CRAZY-hot. 
 The title pretty much tells you what this book is all about. Chase is well a hot cop. 
 There's always a woman waiting in the wings for a hot cop like him. A flock of them even. In a place like Kansas he's the closest thing we have to a rock star. 
 Livia is a librarian who is approaching 30. She wants children but not a relationship. So Chase agrees to be a sperm donor with no strings attached. That's pretty much it. What I liked about this story was the well-developed characters and the funny banter. And the Kelley Trio - yes Officer Kelley! 
 Livia and Chase are insanely attracted to each other but both are extremely gun-shy about permanent relationships but they sure have loads of fun trying to make a baby! 
 Megan you never told me your brother was a hot. Oh my God. I didn't just say that. 
 But I totally did. My face is heated with embarrassment. A cop! I meant a cop. 
 This is a fun sexy story with a very low angst factor. If you are looking for a guilty pleasure to enjoy for a few fun hours then this is the book for you!"
"No matter what happens even on your worst day find something to be grateful about. It'll make you feel better. 
 What a gorgeous book!! Emma Scott has a way of writing that is so beautiful it is almost painful. But she also makes her characters seem real very human funny flawed and just very authentic. 
 Zelda finds herself all alone in New York City having been robbed and left with nowhere to stay She came to New York to try and see her graphic novel but is rejected and told to revise her project to give it more heart. She and Beckett meet by chance and I am not sure I have ever encountered two lonelier people than these two. 
 One person alone against winter was rough. But two people together... Together. A word I never used. 
 Beckett and Zelda both have heartbreaking pasts. They both can't seem to move on but Beckett takes a chance on Zelda and lets her stay with him in his tiny apartment temporarily and just as roommates. Slowly they begin to realize that they care for each other but neither of them think they truly deserve happiness. This is a slow-build romance and the author takes care in creating a connection between the two main characters. I could feel them falling in love and was literally sobbing at the end. It is hard to explain when a book has that certain spark that makes it memorable but whatever it is The Butterfly Project has it all. The writing is beautiful and there is plenty of steam but it is believable and very explosive when Beckett and Zelda finally get together. 
 ...I realized you could get used to anything--even being alone for years -- right until the moment you touched something better than what you had. 
 A very sexy and emotional story The Butterfly Project is one of my favorite books. It is a powerful tale of love and forgiveness. And the extras in this book are absolutely fantastic! All the stars to Emma Scott for this gorgeous story. 
 You are my home baby he said. I never want to be anywhere else.

"4 1/2 Stars!! 
 What a beautiful gripping and intense story! I jumped into 'Preston's Honor' without knowing too much about the plot. There is so much to love about this book: second-chance love burning passion forgiveness and compassion. Lia Preston and his brother Cole all grew up together in rural California. Lia's mother was a migrant farm worker and Lia always felt the pain of poverty and the sting of feeling not good enough. Not only did she have to endure teasing and bullying at school her mother was also cold and unfeeling towards her. 
 Nobody girl. Nobody girl. Nobody girl. Me. 
 My heart!! Both brothers loved Lia but through a series of events it is Cole who begins to date Lia. Life happens Preston and Cole leave for college and Lia is left behind in the small farming town. There are no opportunities for her to continue her education and she is resigned to accept her lot in life. I absolutely love how the author sheds light on the conditions and the plight of our nation's migrant farm workers. Lia does her best but ends up working for minimum wage in order to support herself and her mother. 
 The only bright spot in her life is Preston. She is overjoyed when he returns to town. Bound together by a tragedy it is difficult to know whether their love will survive. 
 Annalia. Christ. Seeing her again had been simultaneously torturous and joyful. I gripped the hair at my forehead a sound of frustration coming up my throat. Hadn't that always been the case? Only this time . . . this time the shock of seeing her as a woman had nearly stopped my heart. I'd felt . . . breathless. Struck mute. Consumed. 
 Will Preston and Lia be able to find happiness? Things really do seem hopeless for them and there is much heartache and misunderstandings between them. Lia was a lovely honest caring and gorgeous character (inside and out) and Preston was magnificent. My heart almost stopped several times while reading this passionate story! I was desperate for these two to find happiness. 
 Thank you Preston. For being my friend once for giving me my first dance for watching over me. It was all I had. It would have to be enough. 
 Once again Mia Sheridan does not disappoint. I highly recommend this beautiful tale of second chances redemption and mercy. And the Prologue was a stunner!! Happy tears were flowing all around. 
 Or actually maybe this is exactly where we were meant to start. Tonight. This is our beginning Annalia."
"I want to own every inch of your skin to be the only man who touches you who tastes you. You think I wouldn't bid on a woman? That I shouldn't bid on you of all people? I'll spend every cent I have break every goddamn law to keep you. 
 The second book of the Endgame series begins right were 'The Pawn' ended. Avery has really hit rock bottom. She is living in a rundown motel and has lost everything. But she is determined to get back what is precious to her and 'The Knight' is another deliciously dark romance that features some great characters and writing. 
 Gabriel really cares for Avery. He is outwardly cruel but their scenes together are everything I love about Skye Warren's writing. He was almost brutally cruel in the first book but here he seems to finally show his true feelings. But Avery wants nothing more then to get revenge on the man she believes led to her father's downfall. Make no mistake Gabriel Miller is still a harsh and brutal figure and he still remains mysterious. 
 I love the supporting characters in this book and would love to read more about Avery's mother! The circumstances surrounding her death become more and more mysterious and I hope that the third book in this series tells more of her story. 'The Knight' ends on a surprising note and I can't wait to read 'The Castle' the third book in this series. 
 Skye Warren once again delivers the goods in this story. This series is dark very sensual and dangerous. Highly recommend these books for all lovers of dark and sexy romance."
"Some of the best times in life come from bad ideas. 
 Sometimes you need a good old-fashioned romance to lose yourself in and Egomaniac is just the book! Vi Keeland once again shows her talent for writing a funny sexy tender-hearted romance that is creative engaging and sweet. 
 I enjoyed every minute of this book. Emerie and Drew meet cute and I was drawn in from the very beginning. What separates Vi Keeland's romances from the rest of the books out there is the heated chemistry between her characters and their wonderful banter. Emerie is new in town and winds up renting space from Drew an aggressive divorce attorney. He is a commitment-phobe for very good reason. I loved the way the author slowly revealed his history and I absolutely adored his POV!! This book is literally laugh-out-loud funny. 
 And I suppose all of your women are fast asleep after you take care of them. 
 Damn straight. I'm like a superhero. The Prolactinator. 
 Egomaniac is a super-sexy very fast-paced read that has lots of warmth and heart. It is witty and smart and very addicting. I loved all of the secondary characters and I hope that at least one of them is getting their own story soon! I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading many more stories from this very talented author. 
 Maybe just maybe neither one of us had found the right one before now...because we hadn't met each other yet.

"Imagine a hospital where the structure itself becomes part of the healing process or a home for dementia sufferers that actually helps them to remember. This house might be simple but it's ambition is extraordinary. 
 A fantastic psychological thriller that I could not put down!! Would you be willing to give up almost all of your worldly possessions for a chance live in a stunning home for very little rent? That is the fascinating premise of this book by JP Delaney a pseudonym for a well-known writer. I read that the author did not want to reveal his/her gender because the book is told from a female point of view. I did not know this when I first read a sample and the author succeeded in making me feel as though I was inside the narrators' minds. 
 The brilliant architect Edward Monkford has designed One Folgate Street in London a high-tech house with cutting edge design. Edward is a follower of minimalism to the extreme so much so that the tenants must agree to abide by his extreme de-cluttering rules and regulations. But he sees his rules as so much more than control and firmly believes that a house really can change you from within. If you have to de-clutter your life then you will begin to see what is truly important in life and you will free your mind to become a better person. 
 Emma and Jane are both looking for a fresh start. They are required to fill out a stringent and lengthy application in order to pass on to the final level of approval which is a very brief meeting with the owner and designer of One Folgate Street. The rent is low and the house is located in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood. 
 Edward is difficult mysterious brilliant moody...but the chance to live in the magnificent home is so tempting the women overlook all of this in order for a chance to live at One Folgate Street. The home is equipped with the latest high-tech gadgets and the tenants must answer periodic questionnaires in order to continue living in the house. The evaluations test their ethics their physical well-being and their state of mind and are quite literally crucial to continues living in the house. 
 That's all anyone's looking for really isn't it? Someone to take care of the mess inside our heads? 
 The descriptions of the home are absolutely enthralling. I am still thinking about this book weeks after finishing! The idea of extreme de-cluttering is very thought-provoking and is woven inextricably into this intriguing story. Is Edward as dangerous and unhinged as everyone seems to think he is? This is a classic tale where NOTHING is as it seems. I literally read this book over the course of 2 days and was shocked by the surprising conclusion. 
 The story is told from the point of view of Emma who is seeking a safe neighborhood and a secure home after a recent break-in and Jane who has suffered a tragic loss and is seeking a new beginning. Their stories converge in a creative way and I loved how the author kept me guessing until the very last page. The house literally plays a central role in this book and to me is one of the main characters in this story. If you are looking for a thrilling read that will challenge you and your boundaries then The Girl Before' is for you!! I LOVED it and highly recommend it for all fans of domestic thrillers.

"3.5 Stars 
 'Bombshell' was not quite for me but was an engaging and verrrry sexy romance. I adore C.D. Reiss's writing and I know that not every book is for every reader. SO although I love her trademark staccato-style of writing it just didn't work for me here. This book seemed to be written more in the style of a screenplay which is fine but the rapid shifting between dialogue and settings was disorienting for me. 
 I didn't really connect with the MC's until late in the book and I wanted to feel a connection not only TO them but BETWEEN them. And the near-constant discussion of bodily functions was just very uninteresting to me. Would this make a cute movie? Absolutely. It just didn't work for me as a romance novel. 
 The stereotyping of wealthy Hollywood insiders and the way they raise their children and constantly chase after their staff was also very uninteresting to me. I did enjoy the latter half of the book and loved the way Brad grew as a person and as a new father to Nicole. I am definitely in the minority on this book so by all means give this one a try if you love books about single dads and Hollywood superstars. C.D. Reiss continues to be one of my favorite romance authors and I will always read what this woman writes!

 If you can't trust yourself who can you trust? 
 OMG!! Intelligent and thrilling page-turner that I read in almost one sitting! The rather abrupt ending was a little unsatisfying BUT the clever story kept me guessing. 
 I think most people do something or fail to take action that may cause some guilt. Well this story begins with Cass taking a shortcut late at night and failing to stop and help a woman who is stopped on the side of the road. 
 The motorist ends up dead. Cass feels guilty but just as significant are the little things she begins to forget...how to run the washing machine making dinner plans with friends and even rather significant purchases. Her mother suffered from early-onset Alzheimer's. What is happening to Cass? 
 Cass's mental well-being soon spirals out of control and she fears she will suffer the same fate as her mother. 
 I literally could not put this book down! I FELT Cass's hysteria and fear. The last part of the book was thrilling and surprising and gave me everything I love about thrillers. I highly recommend this one for all fans of this genre and even if you want to step outside your usual genre. Cass was a memorable heroine and I was cheering for her all throughout the book. This is my first book by B.A. Paris and she has now become one of my faves!!

"This book started off as something else and then turned into a very adult very erotic very explicit romance that I really fell for. 
 The first part of the book begins in college with Sabrina falling for the bad boy Donovan. I will admit that the beginning of this book which was released as a separate novella did not really hold my interest. But when the book fast-forwards 10 years and Sabrina has moved to New York WOW!! The Laurelin Paige that I know and love returned with a bang. 
 Sabrina is hired to work at the company run by Donovan and Weston. She is smart driven and extremely competent. But yet she is still in many ways the insecure college student who felt out of her league with wealthy men like Donovan and Weston. 
 This book is EXTREMELY explicit and explores the taboo subject of rape fantasies. So if that is not your thing then you will not like this story. But if you are a fan of rollercoaster emotions then you will love this book. 
 Sabrina has always been obsessed with Donovan. But he is distant cold sarcastic. She and Weston have a fling but she realizes that she still has deep feelings for Donovan and cannot resist his allure. 
 I don't want you to touch me like Weston I said once and for all. I don't want Weston! I want you! 
 Donovan let loose the smallest hint of a smile. I know. I was waiting for you to know too. 
 Sabrina goes back and forth with her feelings for Donovan. He was downright cold to her BUT he is so hot she cannot stay away. I felt that this book really picked up around the 40% mark and I would urge everyone to give this thrilling and extremely sexy story a try. 
 Why the 4 stars? I loved the absolutely electrifying chemistry between Sabrina and Donovan. The sexy times are off the charts. I did not love Sabrina's lack of self-esteem and her feelings of worthlessness. I hope in the next book she goes after what she wants. I found this book to be very engrossing surprising and very very adult. So that for me is a win. 
 I love these kind of books where the hero is damaged and unloveable yet becomes obsessed with the heroine. I hope we get Donovan's POV in the next book and I cannot wait for the conclusion to Sabrina and Donovan's story!! 
 Were you even going to say goodbye? I asked pretending to balance accusation with acceptance when really I was hoping he'd say he'd changed his mind about going at all. 
 He smiled lazily. I don't know what you mean. I'm still here. 
 You're just as much already gone. 
 His face was in the shadows but I could feel his expression sober even if I couldn't see it. I'm less gone than you'd imagine.

"4.5 Dark Dirty and Delicious Stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy from Author and TRSOR Promotions 
 It feels like I've been dying waiting for this book where we get to finally find out what happens with Pup and King. 
 In King we were left with King and Pup being separated for all the wrong reasons. 
 Now Pup is back where she doesn't want to be but desperately wants to know who she is. While King is vowing to make wrongs right but in his world that's not always easy. 
 Pup. Doe. Ray. Whatever the fuck her name was. I loved her more than what was normal rational or sane and I would gladly rot in fucking prison with a smile on my face if I knew my girl was going to be okay. 
 Pup and King have quite the journey to find their version of happiness. Especially without the ever present Preppy to help them through. 
 I'm not afraid of you anymore I'm only afraid of a life without you. 
 The push and pull of these two. Gah! You feel their pain and torment but are rooting for them to find their version of a HEA. Their bond is beautifully delicious and so perfect. They are the last two people you would put together but for them it works. 
 Both of their worlds aren't as they seem to be. While the hard truths are coming out what they once knew is getting destroyed piece by piece. Even though elements are imploding around them their feelings for one another are just getting stronger and stronger. With Preppy gone and Bear in the middle of his own war good Ol' Jake is recruited to help have King's back when its needed most. 
  . . .When you come in and the choice is between me or her you chose her. You always chose her. 
 There is so much I want to say but can't as it will give the book away. What matters most is I loved it! If you like a darker read but with loads of heart then this series is for you. 
 Was it amazing? Yes. Was it worth the wait? Yes. Did I like the ending? Loved it. Do I love Pup and King? Yes as they are one of my favorite couples. Why I love this series? Because its dirty gritty and right. So often lately I have been left disappointed in the romance genre but I have found that dark romances are filling the void for me. As the couples are more real and honest. The girls are strong and the men are truly 'bad ass'. This series isn't pretty and cute  it's raw and edgy and loaded with so much heart. 
 Oh Pup. I'm pretty sure even death couldn't keep me from you. 
 I gotta say December can't come fast enough for Bear's story in Lawless. Love this series. Love T.M. Frazier and can't wait for more from this series and this author.

"3.5 Not such a lady stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of St. Martin's Press via NetGalley 
 So a bounty hunter and a fugitive walk into a bar ... At first this seems like it is a beginning of a joke but what it is is a couple from opposites sides but fighting for the same thing. 
 Grace is supposed to be a kick ass bounty hunter but has to fight to be appreciated being a girl in a man's profession. Finally getting the chance to show her worth she has to bring in Raide Knox. 
 The problem is that she's already met Raide and sparks flew. How does she bring in a man who not only makes her flutter but is also way larger than her. She decides to seduce him as her plan but first she has to follow him to get an idea of what makes him tick. 
 Silence now and Raide stops right beside the bush I'm hiding pathetically behind. I hold my breathe and try not to move. It really wouldn't look good if he found me like this. I close my eyes. I hope my cupcake is okay. Dammit I really wanted it. 
 The more she follows and runs into Raide the more she falls for his charms. The problem is that she's lying to him while she gets closer to him. Where as Raide for the most part is an open book without a hidden agenda. Even though he wants revenge he also wants Grace. Now he's trying to figure out how he can get both. 
 There doesn't need to be music for two people to move together and make somethin' special. 
 Right and wrong? Tough choices when your heart is on the line. 
 . . . you should always fight for what you love. 
 The longer the gig goes the more Grace loses her heart to Raide but turns into a hypocrite where truths lie. 
 I know I'm not being fair because I'm as big as liar as Raide. . . . 
 These two may have met for the wrong reasons but they want to be together for the right ones. How can they make it work? 
 For the most part I did quite like this book. It was my first Bella Jewel book (insert gasp here) but it won't be my last one as I was engaged and liked her characters. What didn't work for me was a few things. 
 1)The endearment 'Lady'. I gotta admit there's just nothing sexy or endearing about this title. I don't know why but for me it does the complete opposite effect I assume it's going for. Every time I hear it I cringe a bit. 
 I never said I was goin' to kiss your lips lady. 
 2)Mostly Grace was a strong character but her continuous crying made her a 
 bit weaker for me. Don't get me wrong I don't think crying is weak at all but she was like a bloody leaking faucet with her crying that it 
 again did the opposite effect for me 
 Did I love Grace and Raide together? I liked them but didn't love them. They had hi and low moments for me during the story. Did I like this book? Yes but I think I liked the idea of the story more than the actual story. Will I continue with this series? Yes. Will I read more from Bella Jewel? Definitely.

"2.5 to 3 Good but predictable and forgettable stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Loveswept via NetGalley 
 I am a huge fan of sports romance and this one did fit the bill but it also didn't. I liked the story but I didn't love it. The heroine didn't get on my nerve. The hero was super sweet. But I was still left with wanting more as it was just okay. It was one of those books that was good but predictable and forgettable. 
 Ryker's such a sweetheart and I wish there were more men fictional or real that solely want committed monogamous and that were great loving full time fathers. He was so loveable but it also left you wanting more because he was too sweet and there wasn't a lot of tension. When reviewing I feel like Goldilocks sometimes where we nitpick on everything because we are wanting that perfect combo of tension passion drama love etc... and when we don't get it then it falls unfortunately flat. 
 I liked the idea of the story where Grayson (Gray) is supposed to be the first female GM of a NHL team which could have been totally kick ass. She was also a genius and a past female hockey Olympian and a scout and a business guru etc.... her traits and qualifications were almost too much making her not as likeable. Between Gray and Ryker it's supposed to be forbidden relationship due to their work conflict and it is but it didn't feel that daring that we were biting our nails waiting for them to get caught. 
 As Gray is trying to be successful in a man's world it shocked me with this advice below. 
 Gray he says gently. If you have a chance at love you should never let anything stand in your way. And I mean anything. Not even this job. 
 Don't get me wrong I don't think that woman should have to give up love to be successful but there is definitely a balance. Which was found for Gray but it lost part of its essence when Gray's the one giving up so much. Sure it was explained well of why but I wished for a different outcome I think. I still wanted a HEA but with a strong female lead and the male giving up something which is a bit more unconventional in the romance genre. After reading this I think it was one of the things that could have helped this book have more oomph. Don't get me wrong I do understand if it was that way than Ryker may have come across weaker but that could have been prevented with Ryker having a bit more edge to him then him being all soft and sweet. 
 Did I like it? Yes but didn't love it. Will I continue with this series? Yes. Favorite Part? I don't know if I have one as nothing really jumped out as super memorable for me but if I had to pick then it would be Ryker with his girls or Ryker with the spider.

"5 Raw and painful but also poetically beautiful stars!!!!! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Atria 
 Genre: Adult Contemporary Romance 
 Standalone 
 My It Ends With Us Review . . . 
 I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!!!! 
 Be that girl Lily. Brave and bold. 
 From beginning to end this book had me hooked. My heart went through a roller coaster of emotions but it was so worth it. It has been awhile since I read a Colleen Hoover book (insert wrist slap here) and I truly missed her writing but what a book to jump back into with her. There were so many emotions packed into this book that it's hard to truly formulate my review. 
 Lily. Life is a funny thing. We only get so many years to live it so we have to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be. We shouldn't waste time on things that might happen someday or maybe even never. 
 Lily Bloom has learned some hard lessons. So when Ryle Kincaid enters her life she feels like she can be honest with herself and have her some day. Ryle started off as flirting and only wanting a one night stand but quickly finds Lily under his skin that he can't get her out of his mind. 
 I don't think being a little guarded is a negative thing I say. Naked truths aren't always pretty. 
 At first Ryle and Lily start with flirtations and naked truths of honesty but then it ends up as so much more. 
 There's a really big naked truth coming okay? he says. Brace yourself. 
 With these naked truths she starts to see a deeper side of Ryle that he worms into her heart. These truths also help her to take a risk and follow her dreams. As she starts to follow her dreams Ryle finally caves and changes his ways to have Lily in his life. 
 I'm going to make a promise to you he said. When my life is good enough for you to be a part of it I'll come find you. But I don't want you to wait around for me because that might never happen. 
 Sometimes lessons like to repeat themselves in different forms. Often the lessons don't stop until you learn what you need to learn from them and sometimes the truth isn't pretty. With these lessons it also helps us see differently when we are in the shoes of someone or something we have judged in the past. 
 It's not a person's actions that hurt the most. It's the love. If there was no love attached to the action the pain would be a little easier to bear. 
 The past present and future often can get tangled up with wants and needs and the heart has a hard time sifting through these entanglements. What was right in the past doesn't always mean it's right in the future and vice versa. 
 In the future. . . if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again . . . fall in love with me. He presses his lips against my forehead. You're still my favorite person Lily. Always will be. 
 Loving and letting go are both hard. Choosing between your heart and your head can be very difficult. But ignoring your gut can be disastrous. And for poor Lily she gets put through the wringer in her emotional journey of growth and development of herself. 
 When you experience it firsthand it isn't so easy to hate the person who mistreats you when most of the time they're your godsend. 
 Learning life lessons are tough. But the lessons are often worth the reward once you finally break the pattern. Without this you will continuously experience the pattern until you make the change and for some that never happens but for Lily she was strong enough and brave enough to make the change. 
 It stops here. With me and you. It ends with us. 
 Gah! This book hit me right in the feels. It was such an emotional journey and my heart broke for all of the characters. You can tell that this story is something personal to Colleen and I think she did a tremendous job making her words come to life. This book was so well written especially with way it was set up that we got to experience the present and the past simultaneously. This was such an amazing way to be able to experience all the emotions at once while we went on this journey with Lily. This book is raw and painful but also poetically beautiful. There are so many things I want to say about this book but it will give too much away instead I highly recommend it so you can enjoy the emotional journey on your own."

 The first book in this series is Trust the Focus which I quite liked. The first book helps set up for this book but it isn't completely necessary to read this one. In Trust the Focus Justin and Landry were best friends. To help save Landry from loving his best friend from a far he makes up a boyfriend. The boyfriend he makes up and the picture he uses is Riley Sorenson who is an up and coming male underwear model. Focus On Me is focused on Riley and his journey of self discovery. The two books are interlinked via pen pal relationship with Landry and Justin but in the end Riley and Colin are truly their own story. 
 Colin Hartman is tired of failing. He just can't seem to find his grove. Now after his most recent failure he's on his way back home with his tail between his legs. Riley Sorenson is just plain lost. He's on a personal journey to help him find himself. After a random meeting these two find out they need each other. Riley needs a ride and Colin needs some sort of purpose. 
 On Colin's long way home from college he agrees to give Riley a ride. What he didn't expect was to get so much more than he bargained for. They start the journey with curious wonder but end with so much more. At first they are at arms length with each other but then realize that they can maybe help one another. This spark explodes but then turns sour. 
 We were enablers. 
 The more Colin learns about Riley the more he needs to help him. The only problem is he doesn't know how. 
 He's the one thing in my life I haven't quit yet and I don't plan to fail now. 
 This journey isn't just about Riley finding himself it's also about Colin's own journey of the same. 
  . . . You're so hung up on your failures that I don't think you see that sometimes you have to fail to set yourself on a different path. 
  . . . You have to quit keeping this tab in your head of what you lost and what you won. Because then you miss the journey. 
 Riley's in a very dark place and finally for the first time he feels something. With a spark of hope he thinks Colin could be the answer but quickly learns that it's not enough. To get better he needs to want it himself. Both of these two beautiful men have their own personal demons and insecurities. Their journey is a very meaningful and beautiful one about love and self discovery. 
 Their journey is not an easy one but it's full of some much hope and love that you are rooting for these two to find some sort of happiness. And especially with each other however to get there it's a lot of work. 
 This story felt so real. You felt their pain and struggles their darkness and hopelessness. But you also felt their hope. This was a beautiful love story about two halves that make a whole. But to get that whole they have to love themselves first before they can truly love each other. Great Story! I love this series and I can't wait for more.

 Edie is quite the feisty character borderline more bitchy than feisty but she had spunk. To some she may be a crazy cat lady but to others an intriguing enigma. 
 Magnus is a go getter and wants things a certain way so the spirited cat lady doesn't make his radar. However Edie's sister Bianca and Magnus's brother Levi convince Magnus to take pity on Edie. He may have not started out thrilled about this arrangement but with the help of some angry felines and a cat behaviorist things changed. 
 Hunter: I have to ask. Are you . . . adopting several cats? 
 Magnus: Just one cat lady. 
 I gotta admit NOT a fan of Bianca or Levi at all. Poor Edie she doesn't trust easy especially because of her past. So the last thing she needs is pity and more lies. Magnus may have started the journey for the wrong reasons but ended up staying for the right ones. 
 The first book in this series didn't win me over but I quite liked this one. It had humor and heart with a nice balance of steam sex and substance. Thankfully the heroine was strong not whiny. While the heroine was rich sexy and sweet. Do I like this author? YES. Do I like this series? Yes. Did I like Edie and Magnus? Yes. Was I excited to have Gretchen and Hunter involved in this story? Hell Yes. If Bianca or Levi are the hero or heroine of their own stories will it be hard to like them? Yes. 
 Will I continue with this series? YES.

"2.5 Meh Stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Berkley | Penguin Group 
 Unfortunately this was another meh for me. It didn't not like it but it also didn't wow me as well. As I was starting to read the book I couldn't even recollect what this series was about nor what the first book was about. After refreshing my memory via Goodreads I tried to dive in to this story but it never fully caught me. 
 This book is part of a series but can be read as a standalone. Kiefer Rogan is one of three who worked in Special Forces along with Tag and Jasper. We meet all of these boys in Strong Enough which was Jasper's book and the basis of this series. Even though there was a previous base it didn't feel like it was a super strong part of this book. 
 Rogan is ex-special forces current MMA fighter an actor and a 'player'. Katie is an ex-actor and now a current make up artist with a chip on her shoulder which comes from her past. 
 Both of pasts and scars to remind them of them every day. 
 Katie didn't want any man in her life but Rogan got under her skin and weaseled his way into her heart. For Rogan the moment he met Katie he knew something was different about her that made him want her even more. 
 The more Rogan works to gain her trust and her heart the more Katie's walls come done. However the more the walls come down the more her insecurities come out. Don't get me wrong I totally understand why she's plagued with them as most in her situation would be. However constantly reading about them can sometimes be a more negative feature of a book instead of a plus. 
 I think I finally figured out why insecurities are bothering me as of late when I'm reading. When a story is just one person's POV it's easier to relate to them and their insecurities. When the story is from dual POV's we get to see the other person's perspective which gives us the whole picture. For example in this story we read about Katie's insecurities and the why but we also read about Rogan adoring her and not seeing her scars. He only saw her and loved her. So as a reader we see what she doesn't see. This is great for adding elements of depth to a story but it can also ruin some aspects because we can frustrated with a character for not seeing what is right in front of them. 
 Katie finally lets Rogan in and things are going decently then the dreaded insecure induced assumptions make an appearance causing Katie to run and for Rogan to be stubborn. Sure it gives more angst to the story but its been done too much which makes it too repetitive within this genre. 
 I gave my heart away and this is what it's come to. (What comes is a small pile of horseshit of assumptions which weren't needed and would have made me less frustrated with the story) 
 As Rogan and Katie find themselves apart because Katie won't listen and Rogan is stuck between a rock and a hard place which was made on his own by not communicating to his brother nor Katie. During this part we finally get back to the premise of the series and it ties it in with Jasper and Tag. 
 As these elements come to the surface Katie finds herself. 
 I'm simply a girl who's tired of hiding who's tired of being hurt. Who's tired of only surviving. (About time!) 
 In the end all they can do is fight. Fight to be tough. Fight for each other. Fight to love 
 Fight to survive. Fight to live. 
 This book was one of those books that was decent but unimpressionable. Even while writing this review I had to refresh my memory who the character's names were which only reiterates the point that it was a bit unforgettable. When I come across these books I find them harder to review because they aren't great but they also aren't bad. They're just the middle of the road. This saddens me this time around because I liked the idea of the story and I freakin' adore M. Leighton but in the end it didn't wow me. Will I continue with this series? I think so as I vaguely remember liking Strong Enough which makes Brave Enough have potential."
"4.5 Dark and Beautiful Stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Author and TRSOR Promotions 
 Holy Shit! What a book!!! And what a crazy ending. I can NOT wait till Tyrant. August can't come soon enough. The book was dark and amazing. I gotta admit T.M. Frazier has such a gift at making dark beautiful. 
 Oh! King so many things to say about King. He's dark. He's an asshole. He's loyal. He likes to play dirty. But in the end he loves wholeheartedly. 
 I think you are the most stubborn overbearing anger inducing obnoxious complicated and beautiful man that has ever lived. 
 King and his merry group of friends Preppy and Bear have come from a hard life but turned up okay. Bear's life was better than King & Preppy's past but he still has his own demons. Now that King's out of jail he realizes that he wants more out of life. He just doesn't realize what it is until Doe walks in on him. 
 Doe has lost her memory but she's desperate. Desperate for good shelter and protection. Befriending a junkie prostitute is the best and worst thing that has happened to her. After her friend royally screws her over in the end Doe is the price to pay where King is concerned. 
 However both our confused about each other. For Doe she's torn from who she is now and who she was before even though she doesn't know that part of herself anymore. King has lived a hard life but had made one good thing but now he has to find a way to make that right again. 
 Why don't you just gut me and get it over with? Do whatever it is you want to do to me. Hit me. Fuck me. Fucking KILL me. Just stop. HURTING. Me. 
 The last thing these two thought was that they were going to fall in love. The kind of gut wrenching soul mates type of love. But with this mismatched family it becomes easy between these two once they finally stop fighting it. 
 But it's a dark world so you know shit is not going to be easy for this duo. And let me tell you that it is gut wrenching and hard to watch all the shit that falls on them. When your heart breaks and you get pushed into a corner you don't always make the right decisions. Unfortunately these decision have huge consequences for King and Doe. And now we are left gutted and shocked with how this book ends with a crazy need to find out answers and hope that these two can find a slice of happiness in their fucked up world. 
 Loved it. It was dark gritty and raw. I can't wait for more.

"4 Tattoo Loving Stars!! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of St. Martins via NetGalley 
 Debut Author and I loved it. Trent was superb! Harper for the most part was great with some moments of wtf really. 
 Harper's on the run. The run from her past. The run from herself. Knowing that she's the only one who can change her present she finally makes a decision to move forward. The first step is to tattoo her back. To hide her past and move forward with a new form of peace. What she didn't expect was to fall in love at the same time. 
 Someday you're going to make your peace with this sweetheart. It'll be a painful step that shaped the incredible person that you are. You'll be proud of your own strength and determination and you'll wish you had your own record of this very moment. When you changed the path you were on. 
 There's something about Harper that draws Trent in. He doesn't know what it is but he sure wants to explore it. Unfortunately his past makes him a bit gun shy. But her scared timid ways makes him want to protect her soothe her and take care of her. 
 Not discussing it with you dude because: a) We don't have vaginas and b) You're a dumb-ass. 
 Harper has some issues but for the first time wants to stay put. Normally I'm not a big fan of heroines always running instead of dealing with things but with Harper you totally get why she does it. Scarlett makes it comes across as her issues and not making her look pathetic and weak. Unfortunately this point has been missed a lot with some heroines that I have read about lately. 
 The more Trent and Harper spend time together the more Harper loosens up and starts to trust him. The more she trusts the more she believes that she can find some happiness again. But with this new budding relationship she also gets Cujo Pixie and Leah. With this new group of friends she starts to hope for so much more. But with this new hope and friends she wants to protect them. So they don't get hurt as well with all her drama. 
 Why Drag Trent any further into her drama? (Yes why would we drag the 6'6 man into a scenario where she needs protection. That would be stupid to ask for help. *smell the sarcasm*) 
 Why do some heroines think they need to do everything themselves and not be a burden on anyone else? The sad thing is in reality it makes a person stronger to admit they need help instead of doing it alone. So the more new threats she gets the more she closes up. The more she closes up the more she takes a chance of losing Trent. And the more she closes up the more she wants to run again. But where will she run? From her past or to her future? 
  . . . You're made for each other. You're better people because of each other. It really bothers me that you're going to fuck up the best thing that could have happened to the two of you. 
 Trent's a sweetheart from the beginning. Sure he makes some mistakes but has great intentions. He knows what love is and doesn't want to lose it this time around. Harper started out scared and timid and blossomed into someone so much more. She starts to become a survivor instead of a victim. But with this new found strength she also gets delusional thinking she can handle it on her own. As she quickly realizes that she can't do it alone and needs Trent and her friends to help her through this dramatic time. 
 I love you Harper. Everything else is details. A lot of fucking details granted but just details. 
 This book was great and especially from a debut author. I can't wait to read more from this gang at Second Circle Tattoos.

"3 Didn't love Lily Stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy from Author and Bocci PR 
 I have only read one Jill Shalvis short story as part of an anthology before this (insert gasp) so after hearing and reading such great things about her and her writing I jumped at this chance to read this book. 
 Aidan Kincaid is a bit of a player but he has tons of heart. He's a firefighter rescuer and loyal. He once loved but she left without an explanation ten years ago. 
 Even though he's content in his life it all changes once Lily Danville steps back into Cedar Ridge. Lily is always running. Running from her past. Running from her present. Running from her guilt. Running from everything. But after another bad choice she has to return home with her tail between her legs. 
 Fate has brought these two back together but Lily is determined to keep them apart. 
 I have to admit I was a bit grump going into this book as I was looking for a book to get me out of it. I thought this could be the ticket as it was a fun read with heart sweetness humor and love but it unfortunately had a heroine who annoyed me so instead of taking me out of my grumpy mood it made me a bit worse. Which sucked because it was fun read but Lily did NOT win me over at all. 
 ~The past belongs in the past the past belongs in the past ... ~ (if only Lily actually lived by that mantra) 
 ~Because once upon a time you wanted him and he ... wanted your sister. ~ (Why? Why must heroines always assume without actually talking to the person involved. Why?) 
 He doesn't like me like that (No he just kisses everyone he doesn't like. *insert eye roll here*) 
 Tell me you didn't leave and then not talk to me for ten years because you thought I had something going on with your sister. (No that would be stupid. Of course she did. Argh! ) 
 This is my battle to fight she said. Alone. (Argh! ) 
 ~ But though she could forgive she couldn't quite forget. Not this. ~ (For fuck sakes. LET IT GO already) 
 Let me get this straight. I have a question I come to you you get pissed about it and you what just walk away? Is that it? Is that how this is going to work Lily? (Sadly yes with Lily this is her way of things.) 
 Well I'm not an expert on the good guys  she said. But I am somewhat of an expert on the rotten ones. And they never ask. They tell or worse yet they don't ever call or text. They take what they want and then they vanish. No talking at all. Seems to me if Aidan was asking that's better than nothing right? Maybe he wanted to make sure. Or maybe he just wanted to hear how you reel about him. I mean I know we think we're obvious with our feelings but we're not. (Good advice maybe Lily could get her head out of her ass to see this) 
 Aidan had never made it a secret how he felt for her. He'd been open and frank. Always. And in return she'd . . . been neither of those things. . . . It's me Lily said turning to look at Jonathan. It's all me (Yes it is you Lily. Argh!) 
 Here's the thing that sucks for me. Lily ruined this story for me. As for the rest of the characters I loved them. 
 Now I know that you and your brother are so full of poo your eyes are 
 brown so you listen up good. If you screw this night up for me I'm 
 going to put an ad in the paper saying you're ready to get married and 
 have kids and that all singles should apply. Especially the criers the stage-five clingers and the poetry lovers. 
 Did I love the writing style? Yes. It had charm and humor. Did I like Aidan? Hell Yes! He had heart and wore it on his sleeve even though he was stubborn as an ox. Will I read another Jill Shalvis book? Definitely. Just because I didn't like this heroine doesn't mean I won't like other books. If it was only the writing style and the majority of the other characters I would have given this book a 4 but Lily dragged it down to a 3. As I'm not a fan at all at whiny females who are stubborn and assume assume and assume which leads to miscommunications and unnecessary bullshit.

"3.5 Fairytale Loving Stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy from Author 
 This is my first Katy Regnery book and it won't be my last. In his book it is considered to be a modern day Hansel & Gretel. I've got to admit that it has been over 30 years that I have read that fairytale so it was great to get a modern spin on a very old tale. 
 Here we have Holden 
 and Griselda who are foster brother and sister but have a huge bond after being abducted and held captive together for years. This event caused a strong requited love at a very young age. The one thing that kept them holding up hope were their shared feelings and dreams of the future. On one fateful day they have a chance to escape but their plans get spoiled causing a downward spiral of consequences from that day forward. 
 I'm whole. I'm whole because I'm with you. 
 Now 10 years later fate has intervened and brought these two back together but its not all roses and unicorns with this reunion. Presently Griselda is in an abusive relationship as she thinks its all she deserves after her fateful choice while Holden's going through the motions of life and his bevy of females since his heart is hollow after losing Gris. 
 Besides taunted her cruel mind he has a girlfriend . . . and a shitload of tally marks. (Ugh! Double standards. How can heroines get mad when they have their own boyfriends? How? Plus they were apart for TEN YEARS!!! ) 
 We're both with people we don't even like said Holden reading her mind. Do you have any idea how fucked-up that is? 
 I liked the idea of this book so much but Griselda didn't win me over with all her double standards and insecurities. I get what they went through will play havoc on their emotional development but when reading it at times it becomes too much that you just want to her to finally get her head of the sand. 
 I don't want to judge you for it. Then don't (Good idea. But it would have been to easy for this advice to be taken) 
 Stop shakin' your head Griselda Schroeder because this is my truth and I am sharing it with you and you need to respect that. 
 I'm breaking things off with him when I get home. (Gah! So frustrating) 
 Girl for the record I think this code of silence is crazy. (Agree. WTF? Gris.) 
 You d-don't trust me. (I get their insecurities but at times they became too much and drove me a bit batty) 
 Gris's past choices have caused an extreme collapse in her emotional capabilities when it comes to relationships. I loved Holden but Gris's wishy washy ways didn't always win me over. 
 The moment Holden sees Gris again he knows exactly what he wants. What he's always wanted. He will do anything to get it even though to get their isn't an easy journey. He too had some coward and insecure moments but for the most part he captured me from the beginning to the end. 
 I understand the book being back and forth from past and present to 
 help us get into the mind set up the characters but at times I felt it 
 more distracting then helpful. In the end I quite loved the book but it took me awhile to get there. 
 It is a story about second chances friends to lovers forgiveness survival hope and love. 
 What was my favorite part of the story? The idea of the story. What was my least favorite? Gris's double standards and insecurities. Sorry I know that sounds harsh but there was just something about how she handled things that didn't endear her to me. Did I like the ending? Yes? Will I read more from Katy Regnery? Absolutely. Will I read more from this series? Yes

"4 Eloquent yet raw stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Berkley | Penguin Group 
 It's about accepting that we're both twisted as fuck and the only way we'll ever work this out is together. 
 First let's start with that's it felt like forever since we get to read this book waiting to see what happens with Jonah and Vivienne. Second this book is not for the faint of heart with its explicit content but it's still beautifully crafted with its story telling. This is NOT your typical romance novel. If you are expecting hearts roses and unicorns then this is NOT the series for you. It's dark real hard and raw but yet still hopeful loving and beautiful while also filled with kink and suspense. 
 It is a must that you read Asking For It first as it helps you understand the why and how of what is behind Vivienne & Jonah's issues. 
 What happened to him was stranger and maybe even sicker. We've traveled parallel paths he and I. We were betrayed by those who should have protected us. We've fought for our sanity and won. We've dealt with the dark desires spun from our worst secrets and found ultimate pleasure in them together. 
 After finding out Vivienne's truth Jonah's torn and conflicted causing all kinds of hurt for the both of them. But what they do know is that their feelings for each other a very real and very strong. 
 I want to work on it but-that's my truth that's where I am. If you can't be with me until I'm over it . . . Jonah that's going to be a long time. 
 It's like-like you stopped seeing me as me. Now you can only see me as a victim 
 You don't get to make me whole I say. You have to take me as I am or we're lost. 
 Healthy left me behind a long time ago. 
 Vivienne not only needs this relationship she wants it but it's a tough go to convince Jonah to get back on board. 
 My therapist says totally normal mentally healthy people are as fictional as the unicorn. We're all bent. Just in different ways. 
 As Vivienne and Jonah start to mend their relationship Jonah's past comes back to haunt him. 
 Sometimes there are secrets we keep to protect other people. But sometimes there are secrets we have to tell to protect ourselves. 
 With his past coming to the forefront it causes all of Jonah's demons to emerge. 
 She meant that when people push beyond their boundaries we have to discover what lies on the other side. 
 With his demons at the surface Jonah has to face so much more but will Vivienne get on board with his new needs? 
 But I feel so cheated so deprived and even angry . . . (Whatever happened to the notion of compromise? Oh Vivienne still so much to learn) 
 For this broken duo they have a lot of growing to do and a large uphill journey to help them deal with their pasts. 
 I was the one who came to you. The one who thought we could live out opposite sides of a fantasy without any repercussions. What a goddammed fool I was. 
 Even though the content is rough and hard for some to swallow it's still a story worth telling. It's profound and beautiful. Where we get to feel their pain and hardships. We follow along with them and watch them heal and grow. 
  . . . We don't get all better we don't fix everything that's broken. We just learn how to work around the broken bits. How to do the best we can with what we have and who we are. 
 Is this book for everyone? No absolutely not. If you can handle the content then this is a great book and series. Where we get to see the characters struggles and see them move forward to a new place. For most we forget that our pasts define us but that doesn't mean we have to be stuck there. Instead we can take our past and grow and reform to something different. Not new but different. We can't change or forget the past but how we react or respond to a situation is the ONLY thing we have in our control. Lilah Pace captures this point eloquently. Great book. Great series. I don't know if this was supposed to be a duo or a larger series but there's so much potential for more from this couple or many of the other characters. Fingers crossed there will be more."

 Sometimes when a couple is continued in a second book it can get repititive and tiresome but for these two it was what we needed to see from them. It was never going to be an easy road for these two just being gay but add all the other family drama these two are in for a rough ride. 
 It's okay really. The labels don't matter. 
 Sometimes they do. Sometimes they hurt somebody. 
 Ryan and John have jumped many hurdles to be together but these two have many more to go. 
 Ryan and John might be out to John's family but now they have to come out to Ryan's which isn't sunshine and rainbows for these two. They only way they can fight this is with a united front. These two are solid and face so many challenges that can only strengthens these two. 
 This shouldn't even be a thing you know? I should be able to say 'Hey guys I've found someone to love.' What sex you are which chromosomes you have shouldn't matter. (So totally agree with this sentiment) 
 But not all strong things are built to last. Ryan and John are still trying to wade their way through the land mines of Ryan's family only to have John's ex and his kids be back full time into their world. Because John's so supportive loyal loving and easy going he's getting torn between his old familar family and his new family with Ryan. Sure it would be easy at times to go back to what worked at a time but that doesn't mean that's the right choice. 
 Ryan really has never been in a serious relationship before and now that he and John's bond is being threatened he has to find away to be supportive and still have their HEA. 
 I'm yours you're mine. This what we have all of you and me. No one gets to touch that. 
 There is a lot of ignorance to this LGBT world and poor Ryan and John have to fight an uphill battle with this. The only thing that makes them fight harder is their love for one another. 
 What you made me he said softly was happy. When I wasn't sure I would ever be again. Gay or straight doesn't mean anything compared to that. 
 I so have so fallen in love with Ryan and John. I feel like I have walked with them and all their hardships and have rooted for them the whole way through. Their love story is a thing of beauty and it doesn't matter what color or gender for these two. What matters is their own happiness and love which they both have in spades for one another. This love is what pulls them through the tough times so they can have their slice of happiness in the end.

"4. 5 Holy Hell about time stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Forever Romance | Grand Central Publishing 
 It's been quite awhile since I read a Kristen Ashley book and I'm so glad that I did. Personally my life has been stressful and to add to that I have been in a bit of a reading funk where nothing grabs me. Then I was going through my TBR and saw that I hadn't read this one so I opened up and started reading. And I'm so glad that I did because this book was totally what I needed at this juncture in my life. It was sweet. It was sexy. It had a great alpha male. It had a great second chance story. It had a strong heroine. What is there not to love with those variables? 
 Millie Cross and Logan High Judd had one of those love at first sight young relationships. It was strong and unbreakable until it wasn't. 
 You love a man Millie you believe in him you take him as he is. You go on his journey with him no matter what happens even if that means you have to walk through fire. 
 Now TWENTY YEARS later Millie runs in to the man she has always loved and realizes that it's time to tell him why. The minute High sees Millie he furious and wants to hurt her they way she hurt him. Not only does he want for her to hurt but the MC have his back on this matter. 
 I gave up everything so you could have it all! 
 But that doesn't mean the MC ladies are agreeing to this especially when the see the reciprocal hurt on Millie's face. They all know that there is more to the story then everyone believes there to be. Even though High is mad he also can't stay away from Millie even if its to be an asshole. 
 For these two twenty years has felt like forever as well as no time at all where their feelings are concerned. Millie originally wants to give Logan the truth but his asshole ways are making her think differently about it. 
 Once Millie has had enough with Logan and all the Chaos bullshit she's done. But the truth has also come out causing Logan to realize what he has truly lost. 
 Even though I had a feeling what Millie was keeping closer to her vest it still broke my heart in the actuality of their story. Now that the truth is out these two can finally have their chance. 
 Twenty years apart haunted by you walkin' around with a hole in my soul we're back and we're talkin' about cats and you goin' to Arizona? No I'm not fuckin' jokin'. 
 Did I love this story? Absolutely!! Did I love Millie? For the most part yes even though there were some moments where I got frustrated with some of her decisions and reactions to things but in the end she was great. Did I love Logan 'High' Judd? Absolutely. What is not to love? Even his asshole moments as you know where it's coming from and especially when he's a sweetheart. He's one of those guys who once he realizes the situation takes accountability and owns it while at the same time he moves on and tries to fix what was once broken. Loved this story and I can NOT wait for more from this series."
"4 The most unlikely duo stars 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Author via NetGalley 
 This story is technically book three in this series but can be read as a standalone. Lord is the uunbeknownst brother of Con and Elle is Vanessa's best friend. We first meet both of them in Beneath the Ink. 
 We'll eat our supper and then I'll run you home. You can take your weekend and figure out whether you can handle what's going on here. 
 Lord is fine in his world and the last thing he wants is a rich spoiled girl bothering him. What could someone like Elle want in his pawnshop. Even though he may not want Elle to work at the shop doesn't mean he's not attracted to Elle. 
 Elle doesn't need to work but she likes to keep busy but this time she has a personal reason for wanting to work at the pawn shop. Lord quickly realizes that Elle won't take no for an answer and she has skills that can help him out. Plus he gets to see her everyday. It doesn't take long for these two to give into their mutual attraction. 
 And if I decide I can't? Then what? It's done? Lord's dark gaze grew sharp. Then I get to change your mind. Clothes optional. 
 Their might be hot chemistry between these two but instantly there is also more. They just don't know what it is or what it means yet. 
 Wouldn't have mattered what I was doing. You need me I'll be there. 
 As Elle and Lord get closer their worlds are colliding by the most unlikely source. However this imploding is also making their bond stronger and stronger. 
 Sweet thing you took me from day one. Why should this be any different? 
 These two may seem more unlikely than Con and Vanessa but there is just something special about these two that you can't not fall for them and root for them to find their happiness. 
 You realize you're it for me right? 
 I think I'm getting that. Which works because you're it for me too. 
 They started from different worlds and got thrown into the middle of a shit storm to only come out better for it. 
 But we deal with our demons in different ways. We've all got chains to break free from some might just be prettier than others. 
 I adored these two together and am so happy to have found this series."

 Genre: NA Dark Romance 
 Part 4 of an ongoing series 
 My Kept From You Review . . . 
 Finally we get Killian 'Kite' Kane's story. And what a story it was. Killian for me has always been the mysterious dark horse in this series. Now we find out that there was quite the reason for Killian's dark side. However we also find out what helps tame his inner beast. 
 Savannah AKA Savvy has her own past but she always finds the good bits in everyone. This is part of the gift and curse that is Savvy for Killian. He wants her to find the good in him but he's also tortured enough to think he doesn't have any left and he doesn't deserve any good in his life. 
 Because if you come near me again next time I won't let you go. 
 Even though Killian was young when he met his savior he always knew the potential of her. Which is part of the reason he let her go. Now years later and Savvy has walked back into his life. This time around he won't make the same mistake twice. 
 I absolutely loved Killian and Savvy together. Savvy was a strong kick ass heroine while Killian was the most loyal protective man you could ask for. However they both had their pasts to contend with. 
 Throughout the years Killian still knew what Savvy was to him and held that dear and near to his dark heart. I loved this part of Killian that he kept for her. Nashoda Rose has such a gift at creating beauty in a darker world. Kept from You wasn't nearly as dark as some of the others. Actually it had more light and hope than the others which helped balance the series out. However it's Killian's past and fears that create the darkness within him. The guys of Tear Asunder are all near and dear to my heart and I'm so thankful we finally got Killian's story. Thankfully we have a new character in town with Trevor whom was Savvy's neighbor and we will soon get his story as well. Can't wait!"
"4 Finally Off the Clock Stars!

 I unfortunately had this on my kindle for me to read for ever and now I'm mad at myself that I didn't read this book sooner. Finally we get Rolex's story but also sadly we also get the end of the Market Gardens. This is 8th book in the series and possibly could be read as a standalone but I think its better if its read as a whole series. 
 Blake Raleigh aka Rolex has been around for a bit in this series. Now that his favorite rent boys have retired he returns to the Market Gardens and looks for Jason with a referral from Tristan and Jared. Instantly Blake is intrigued with Jason but isn't sure if Jason can give him what he needs. 
 Blake's a bit eclectic with his sexual preferences. He's a voyeur. He likes to be dominant. He also likes to submit. He's pretty opened minded which makes Jason the perfect fit for him because Jason too is a bit of everything. 
 What starts as a typical agreement between rent boy and consumer turns into so much more. It's not uncommon for someone to fall in love with a rent boy but that emotion can't be trusted until Blake and Jason have the real thing. 
 However this real thing isn't easy when these two come from completely different worlds. How do you explain your partners profession when you fall in love with a rent boy? 
 Actor? Dancer? 
 I suppose those fit. Only slightly louder he added Perhaps a bit less suspicious than 'Cum-guzzling manwhore.'  
 I have loved this series from beginning to end. Every couple has been great but I'm so happy it ended with us getting to see behind the man with the rolex. The chemistry between these two men is off the charts. The give and take of these two men could make your cheeks blush while at the same time you fall with them as they fall for each other. 
 Great Series. Great Chemistry. Great Story. Great Couple."

 Enemies to lovers and lovers to enemies. 
 Jason has some issues mainly keeping his anger in check. He's also confused and was brought up to hate a part of himself. Coming back home wasn't easy but what he felt needed to be done. All he has to do is lose one fight. 
 But how can he lose when he sees his high school crush in the audience. Instead of losing he wants to show his old crush what he's all about. Losing be damned. 
 But what he didn't know is that his crush is also now his punisher after he loses the MC tons of money for not losing. 
 Originally thinking he's in trouble with the MC he tries to show no fear but what Hyde has in mind is anything but punishment. 
 Jason wants to give to Hyde and give in to Hyde but he's confused with what that makes him. Hyde and Jason have quite the push pull relationship but also steamy in a dark sort of way. 
 Did I like this novella? Yes but it was too short for me to completely feel the dark bond between Hyde and Jason. Thankfully there will be more from this series and more from Hyde and Jason. Was it the type of MC I preferred? Kind of but I think I still wanted it more dark. However I did like the dichotomy that was Hyde with his family and his MC. Was this typical K.A. Merikan? Hmmmm it was but it wasn't. It was almost too tame for them this time around but I did still enjoy it.

"3.5 Wicked Stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Big Dog Books via NetGalley 
 Wicked Fall is a spin off series from Shaken Not Stirred (Last Call #5). You don't have to read the Last Call series to love this book. However it does help a bit to meet Woolf before and understand him a bit more. Woolf Jennings happens to be the little brother of Tenn Jennings. Like his older brother Tenn he too wants more than what his lineage had destined for him. 
 Woolf Jennings may be the brother left to run the family business but he's also a man who likes his kink when it comes to sex. Since he has been in college he has been full steam ahead in the avenue of sex. So it makes perfect sense to open up a night club/ secret sex club on his property with his best friend and fellow kink lover Bridger. 
 Now that the club is open all is well in Woolf's world until he comes face to face with his 'what if' of all those years past. His old best friend's little sister Callie Hayes. 
 Callie Hayes has always loved Woolf but after being once rejected she hangs up that dream. She settles for simple and easy until that too explodes in her face. Now back home she wants to find herself again but will seeing Woolf again help or hinder this new Callie? 
 Don't ever call yourself 'pathetically dull' again because that was single-handedly the sexiest most exciting thing I've ever seen in my life. 
 Once Woolf sees Callie again he gets conflicted with coming to terms of his personal preferences and the sweetness of wanting Callie. But he thinks he can't have both. 
  . . . But man hear me when I say . . . you cannot stand beside me in my loneliness forever. It balances me but partner . . . it will destroy you one day. 
 I always wanted you Callie he says and I hear truth in his words. I just didn't think I should have you. Big difference. 
 You heart's tied up big time man he says sagely. It would appear so I mutter. 
 I did like the idea of Woolf and Callie but at times the couple was a bit lack luster. Woolf was supposed to be strong sexy and kinky but his conflict with himself and the possibility of Callie at times made me not love him to the full extent I could have. Callie for me was just meh. She wasn't bad or anything but there just wasn't anything super exciting about her that made me fall in love with her. 
 But let me tell you though that scene in the cabin. HAWT! 
 Just know that what's happening right here . . . right now . . . it's nothing but an experience. It doesn't change the way I feel about you. 
 For most of the book Callie was just meh and then all of a sudden she turned super weak which made her even less endearing in my eyes. 
 I'll give him up. (Ugh! Why? Weak heroines. . . argh!) 
 Because I promised my father I wouldn't. (My bad I thought she was an adult not a child) 
 Did Callie and Woolf have chemistry? Yes. But their emotional relationship was not evolving at the same pace as their sexual relationship. Which made Woolf come across as a bit of a douche at times when their relationship was supposed to go to the next level and all he wanted was to get his rocks off. So when their emotional peak came their emotional relationship felt rushed but their sexual relationship was through the roof. 
 Thankfully Callie eventually finds a backbone and Woolf . . . well he finally sees the light. Thank goodness for that but my question is what happened with Colton? That storyline seems to be left unfinished. Hopefully it will be finished in the next books in this series. I'm excited for Cain's story but I was hoping the next story was going to be Bridger. I guess we will have to wait a bit longer for that one. 
 This is one of those times where I liked the idea of the story more than the actual story. If this book was based solely on chemistry it would have gotten a gold star. However the main couple had more potential then they ended up being in the end. Did I like them? Yes I just didn't love them. As I said earlier they were a bit lack luster and a tad forgettable. However Bridger now that man intrigues me. I can't wait to find out his story. Was this my favorite Sawyer Bennett book? Sadly no but it was still good.

"3.5 Still MC Lite Stars!! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Gallery Books via NetGalley 
 Finally Tracker's story. From the beginning of this series I have loved Tracker and it felt like I've been waiting forever for his story. 
 From the moment Tracker met Lana he was a goner unfortunately he had a wee bit of baggage to get rid of first. However his baggage wasn't so happy about this choice. 
 Lana has liked Tracker from the start but he's everything she shouldn't want and he also already has a girlfriend. Plus Lana has her own secrets and doesn't know how to find balance between her world and reality. 
 The minute Tracker kicks his baggage to the curb he's plotting on how he can win Lana over. Lana wants Tracker but doesn't trust his new intentions as her insecurities start to take over. 
  . . . Tracker's a goner when it comes to you. It's good though. He deserves someone like you. 
 Love Tracker and all that he is. Such a softie that Tracker and when he knows what he wants he will do anything to make it happen. But will their worlds be to different to make work? Tracker has to work hard to win over Lana. 
 I would do anything to protect you Lana to protect this. It was in this moment I lost my heart to him. 
 Once Tracker starts to get what he wants he fears that if Lana truly sees him that she won't want all that comes with him. 
 You know it's all I want right now. I don't want you to see something you don't like and want to run. I need you tied to me. Bound. In deep. 
 The more Tracker wins me over Lana's doubts and insecurities start to drown her and lessen my like for her. She can't trust in what she has so she questions everything even though Tracker hasn't really done anything to warrant it. Or if he did do something all she had to do is ask instead of getting her knickers in a bunch. 
 I know he didn't do anything but why do I feel like damage has been done anyway? (Argh!) 
 These men of the Wind Dragons all have soft hearts but that should be pretty easy for them since their MC world seems to be pretty tame compared to others. I actually quite like the idea of this series but I keep craving more oomph depth and darkness from these MC brethren. 
 This will never be done with. Never. We're not perfect but as long as we aren't giving up then fuck it we can make it work. 
 Even though I would still consider this more MC lite to medium I did like it how can you not with Tracker as the main man. Will I continue with this series? Yes I need to know what happens to the rest of the MC as this series does have tons of potential and keeps getting a bit better with each book. Favorite part of the book? Tracker. Least favorite? Lana's doubts and insecurities.

"3.5 MC Medium Stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy from Gallery Books via NetGalley 
 Poor Arrow. He broke my heart at the end of Dragon's Lair that I was hoping that he would get his well deserved MC HEA. From the moment Arrow saw a pic of Anna he was hooked. 
 But Anna is the precious little sister of Rake/Adam which means she's off limits. This however doesn't stop Anna from crushing on bad ass Arrow and all his grumpy ways. 
 Arrow now has demons losing his last love and the choices and repercussions after that. It's easier to drown his sorrows then deal with the reality. Which is a life where he doesn't think he deserves any happiness when Mary is gone. 
 I think you're really something Anna. But people I care about get hurt. If you're smart you will hide what I can so easily see in your eyes because it makes me tempted to take what you're offering. 
 Arrow and Anna have a song and dance schtick for awhile then Arrow finally takes what he wants and damn the repercussions. 
 I'm not used to having to explain myself Anna and I don't fuckin' like having to do it now. You either have faith in me and trust me or you don't. 
 Even though Anna is getting used to this MC world she still wants to be Arrow's equal. That doesn't mean that's going to happen with any ease. Since the MC world is different than hers. 
 Her family had wanted more for her even though they are in the MC world and have brought her in it. But they can't have their cake and eat it too where Anna's heart is concerned. 
 You think I'd choose some overbearing criminal if I had the choice? You're it for me whether I like it or not. 
 A few hoops and some inner demon slaying later and Arrow collects his prize. 
 I see no other option for us. You're mine Anna that's all there is to it. It's not a choice it's a fact. 
 Anna was supposed to be feisty and sexy but at times she came across more bitchy then old lady. As well as when the truth comes out Anna let me down a bit. Sure the news was shocking. Yes. But if she has Arrow's back then I wanted her to have it instead of woe is me and waiver. Do I think she deserved time to digest this news. Yes. But I wanted her to get her head out of her ass way sooner. If Tracker didn't go fetch her I don't know if she ever would have made it on her own in time. 
 At times the story was too predictable but this story did have more grit then Dragon's Lair and Arrow was a bit more bad ass and alpha like. Funny enough Sin/Dex came across more bad ass and alpha in this book then his own. 
 Now Janet was quite the bitch/shit disturber. Janet caused all kinds of trouble but I found her storyline just petered out without completion. Hopefully in the other books this story line will get completed if not then I felt like it needed a bit more resolving. 
 Did I like this story ? Yes. Was it more MC like than Dragon's Lair? Yes. Was it enough to my MC standards? Not yet. This series has potential and it seems it's getting better and better. From the beginning Tracker has been my favorite so I can't wait for his story. Fingers crossed it meets more of my bad ass dark edgy alpha MC ways.

"5 My Heart Still Hurts Stars!!! 
 ~ I don't even know how to function anymore. Bright Side wasn't only my best friend she was like my other half . . .the other half of my brain the other half of my conscience the other half of my sense of humor the other half of my creativity the other half of my heart. How do you go back to doing what you did before when half of you is gone forever? ~ 
 After Bright Side I immediately started to read Gus which was a gift and a curse. It was a curse because my heart hurt so much after Bright Side that I should have given it a bit of rest before diving back in. However it's also a gift because Gus helps to ease the heart in the end. 
 After the loss of Bright Side Gus is devastated and is floundering through life. With no reason to really live and carry forward. He's going through the motions for the band but not really experiencing anything. 
 Gustov you're stalling. You're wasting time. You're not living. You're not doing what you love. 
 God! Poor Gus my heart broke along with him while he tried to find his bearings again. 
 Have you ever been in love? He hasn't blinked. Once. 
 How long did last? Looking back up to the sky he answers. Twenty-one years . . . and three days. 
 Dude my heart hurts for Gus. 
 Listen to me boy. You only get one chance at this circus called life. Don't sit in the crowd watchin' it happen. You jump right in and be the ringleader. That's where you find your fire.  
 What if your fire died with someone else? 
 She shakes her head. Nope. Here's the thing about life boy. We meet a lot of people along this journey. Some of them are sonsabitches and some are special. When you find the special ones you don't take a moment for granted because you never know when your time with them is gonna be up. . . . 
 As Gus is trying to pick up the pieces of his life again he comes across Scout. Whom at first annoys him but then turns into the one person who gets under his skin forcing him to move forward. 
 That's what makes him so special. It's not his talent or his looks. It's how much he feels. 
 Scout has her own issues but between the two of them they help each other and bring out the best in one another. 
 I mean I think people find each other when they're ready for them. When they need each other the most. And it's in that time of need that the strongest relationships are formed. 
 It's a tough transition loving one person all your life and to never have them again while opening up to someone new. Someone who can be a future. It's scary for them but so worth the journey. 
 She knows how much I loved Bright Side but she also knows that doesn't take away from the love I feel for her. My heart's big enough for both of them. Bright side helped make me the man I am and Scout helped me remember who that man was helping me become my own person. I love her so much. 
 Gus had a long way to go to find himself again but what a beautiful journey it was. It was heartbreaking beautiful and perfect. Bright Side and Gus are books that you need to experience on your own to truly understand the emotions that come with these books. 
 I've come to the full realization that my happiness my life falls squarely on my shoulders. No one's gonna do it for me. I'm the one who makes it or breaks it. 
 It's a choice. 
 I absolutely LOVE the way Kim Holden writes and how she portrays emotions 
 in first Bright Side and then continued with Gus. Even thought my 
 heart hurt for weeks after these two books I was happy to see it come a 
 bit full circle in this epic journey. 
 Bright Side and Gus are books that hold a special place in your heart and will be read over and over and over again. I LOVED them. They are by far one of my favorite books. I wear my Bright side & Gus shirts with pride to help share the state of mind the awesomeness that are these books. 
 I so hope there is more from the series. If not I would be content as it was beautiful and perfect and could be left as is but I would love to see some more HEAs from Pax and from Keller as well as the rest of the band.

"4 Eli Loving Stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Intermix | Penguin Group 
 This book is part two in a series but even though Sam and Michael are big characters in this book it still could be read as a standalone. As I read Takeover so long ago I didn't remember all the details but didn't feel lost with reading this book. 
 We originally meet Eli in Takeover and finally get to find out what is behind his gruff exterior. Poor poor Eli. His story guts me a bit but totally makes you fall in love with him and all his brokenness. Justin White isn't what Eli wants but exactly what he needs. 
 Because of you I came 
 here tonight to tie a man up flog him and fuck him. If you want to 
 be that man you better get on your knees right fucking now. 
 Justin is perfect for Eli in all ways expect he has his own baggage which puts a wrench into things when he can't separate the past from the present. When this was happening I was so mad at Justin and how he was handling this. 
 ~ Maybe-just maybe-he needed to let that past go.~ (You think? Insert eye roll for Justin's daftness here.) 
 ~ Had he read Eli so wrong?~ (Ugh! Yes!!!! He did!. Gah! Justin was such a twat when it came to his baggage) 
 If it was just Justin I have to admit I wouldn't have cared too much for this story but Eli steals your heart that you can't not love it and root for Eli to find a slice of happiness. Eli feels like he is a monster but really he's just a broken man with so many rooted demons that at times it becomes too much for him to bare. With Justin he finally is able to let go of some of his burdens and just love. And love is what he does to the full extent. There is nothing half ass for Eli when it comes to matters of the heart. Even though Justin puts him through more hell with his wishy washy ways Eli is still capable of loving so whole heartedly that when Justin finally gets his head out of his ass Eli accepts him back with pure open arms. 
 This book was from alternate POV's but sometimes it wasn't clear whose POV it was that I would have to re-read it to figure who it was. When this happens sometimes it loses part of the flow for me. 
 In the end even though Justin got on my nerve at times and there were some other issues that got me distracted it was Eli that won my heart. For Eli alone he would have gotten 5 Stars but average it all out to 4 in the end.

"3.5 Houston Loving Stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy from Author and Wordsmith Publicity 
 I absolutely love this series and I did like this book but in the end Paige didn't fully win me over. With Paige it's more of a love hate relationship with her. I knew going in that I may not love her as she was quite the bitch in the last two books. Sure she had some good moments but her bitch moments outweighted her good moments. 
 I know we get to find out why Paige is the way she is. As she's just trying to find her place the world and find where she belongs. As part of a twin set it is already tough enough now add in the fact that Cass has MS it makes Paige become second fiddle in her family compared to Cass. With this she tries to pave a way or really bulldoze a path. But with this reckoning she burns some bridges when she tries to right her wrongs. 
 In this sorority world burning bridges is a suicide mission but once she made the decision to do something she plows straight ahead. As she's trying to wade her way through the very caddy bitchy world of her sorority she gets to know Houston. Who let me tell you steals my heart. 
 God! Houston's story. Heartbreaking. You can't help but love him. I guess if anyone is going to bring the best out of Paige it would be Houston. 
 ~ All I know is that when his hands are on me I feel safe. I don't feel the need to pretend everything's okay. Everything just ... is. ~ 
 Now Houston has to fight Paige's bitchy exterior if he wants to make head way to her heart. 
 Yes it is I argue. I hate that I argue. I always argue. ( I too hate that you argue ALL THE TIME. This part of Paige grew a little tiresome for me.) 
 Thankfully Houston sees more in Paige than I do. 
 ~ Not just because of this or because of what we did but because of the girl I get to see the one who's strong but scared. ~ 
 As Houston finally makes head way with Paige she decides to do the one thing that most drives me crazy in this romance genre. 
 Ugh! Why must heroines always make such huge decisions without ever talking to the hero. Why? 
 After Paige makes her very unilateral decision leaving my poor Houston hanging. He has to either let her go or make her realize that what they have is real and true. 
 Wow man. Your girl-crush is a bitch Eli says taking another drink of his beer looking at me over the rim. I think he's expecting me to hit him which I might if he were Casey. Instead I laugh because yeah she's an acquired taste. But she's also a flavor I'd gladly get drunk on. 
 Thankfully Rowe gets to the heart of the matter so Paige can get her bitchy head out of her ass. How she pushed my Houston away for so long baffles me. Sure he has some baggage but he's Houston worlds biggest sweetheart. How can you not make concessions for him and all that he comes with. 
  ... Then . . . I ran into you and you said to come to the game so I came. I'll always come. I'll always pick you Paige. Always ... you. 
 If it was Paige and anyone else I sadly wouldn't have loved this story but thankfully Houston won my heart and made me see more of Paige then I would have normally. 
  ... But thing is with anyone else you'd just be their girlfriend and with me ... you're kind of my world. 
 As usual Ginger Scott has written another great NA story with heartfelt characters even if they are bitchy. She has a way of making you fall in love with these selfless yet have some baggage men but huge hearts. 
 Did I like this story? Yes. Was it my favorite of the three? No. As it's hard to outdo Ty. Do I adore this series? Hells Yeah. Do I hope for more from this series with Eli or Casey? Yep!

"3.5 Inner Demon Slaying Stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Loveswept via NetGalley 
 I wasn't sure how this book was going to play out with Zack losing his partner at the end of Garrett. But it was done well. We find out the truth behind Zack and Gina which gives a chance to root for him to try and find true love and his HEA. 
 After the accident that Zack loses his girlfriend and breaks his wrist. He has had a hard time letting go of the past and guilt and moving on. Thankfully he has his son Ben and the Cold Fury to give him something to live for and make himself move foward. 
 With the help of his sister he's forced to hire a nanny to help with Ben. This helps hinders and haunts Zack. He needs the help but has a hard time rectifying that someone else besides Gina is going to help him raise his son. 
 Kate has learned life the hard way but it has never made her hard. She needs this job as Ben's nanny so she can continue with her masters but she didn't expect the road block of Zack. She knows Zack is battling his own demons but she wants to try and make it better for him. But how can she make it better when she hides herself? 
 Kate has learned to cope by being in the shadows and not sticking out but Zack's able to see more than her baggy clothes and large glasses. Now he just has to keep his thoughts to himself as he doesn't want to cross the line with his son's nanny. 
 Sadly until Kate Zack has been void of all emotions and feelings except guilt after the accident until Kate walks into their lives. With Zack being a bit clueless he convinces the sweet supportive giving Kate for a sex only relationship. We all now that this choice is going to backfire for both of them. 
 It starts as sex only but quickly turns into more from both sides. Zack is a character that at times you love to hate. He has so many things going for him but when it comes to Kate he's so daft that you just want to wring his neck. 
 As for Kate she has nothing but love to give Ben and Zack so when she's finally had enough your heart aches for her. But Zack has many demons to slay before he sees what is and what has always been right in front of him. 
 As usually Sawyer has done a great job with their chemistry and undeniable passion for one another as well as the angst and heartache between this couple. I know this is a fiction book but having some friends in the NHL its hard at times to see discrepancies that takes some of the wind from the sails for me while reading. However if I didn't have that connection it wouldn't be noticed or effect the story for others. 
 Cute Story! Loved Kate and all her happy and sweetness. Loved Zack even though at times his demons tore him apart. These two are so sweet together once Zack got his head out of his ass. 
 I do quite adore this series. Zack's book was great but I have to admit I can't wait for Ryker's book I think its going to be great from just the brief intro of Ryker in this book.

"3.5 Gotta Love Saint Stars! 
 I did like this book so much better than the first book however I think my huge distaste for Rachel is because I love Saint so much that her petty BS bugs me. First its with the nonsense of living through Gina's heart ache and then its with her insecurities and stupidies when they get back together. 
 Falling hadn't been in the plans. Falling for a guy had never even been in my life plan. Gina and I were supposed to be sing and happy forever - workaholics best friends for life . . . (What kind of dumb ass plan was that. Single for life? ) 
 She'd gotten her heart broken before and she'd passed on all the tidbits to me so that I didn't have to go through that too. ( Wtf! I gotta admit this notion makes me angry and was the main reason I didn't love the first book . To live vicariously through someone else's heartache which is the foundation of the future makes no sense to me) 
 Now Saint he is near perfect! I love him. I love everything about his character. Everything. 
 But I can't give you up. I can't give you up even when I want to. I don't want to back off. I don't want to give you up 
 And when I'm ready I'm going to ask you to be my girlfriend and it's 
 going to be the last time I ask Rachel. If you say no that'll be the last no you say to me about anything. 
 In this book we get more Saint thankfully but Rachel . . . 
 I'm a challenge to you Saint. You'll finally get me and then you'll be done with me. (After everything he's done how can she still NOT be convinced of his reasonings. Ugh! He just agreed to start again than her bullshit comes spewing back out again. SO frustrating) 
 If it weren't for Saint I would have NOT liked this series. It's amazing what a great hero can do for a story. 
 I don't know . . . but I'm pursuing it. I'll take this fire any day over the ice I live in. 
 Saint has to wade his way through Rachel's bullshit so he can get what he wants. 
 You use something you discard. And I'll never be done with you. 
 As they start back together Rachel can't be content with that so she has to have something to bitch about so now it's that she can't work with him and have a relationship with him. WTF? 
 that I'd lose what I most want: the possibility of having a long-term relationship with him. (Why can't she have a career and him. Why the conflict? ) 
 As Saint tries to amend her worries Rachel is well Rachel and causes more unnecessary angst. 
 You know what? This is a topic we're not seeing eye to eye on and I'm tired. I'm just going home. (Good idea. Why don't you run home after your fist fight after freshly reuniting. Good job ... not) 
 Ironically thankfully for Gina that gets Rachel's head out of her ass. 
  . . . I know you're a words girls but he's more of a doer than a teller. He's doing things to be close to you. Maybe you should start 'fessing up and telling. (Finally Gina with some good advice instead of her normal toxic garbage that comes out of her mouth) 
 Then more bullshit . . . 
 Saint you're a player the likes of which this city has never seen. ( I just want her to stop throwing his past in his face when he's now being a very thoughtful and loving one woman man.) 
 Then finally . . . 
 He's not a saint Momma I quietly tell her. But I like him very much. 
 I love you like nothing else in my life. 
 I hate it when it's the heroine qualities that ruin the reading experience for me. I loved the concept of the book. I loved Saint. But I did NOT like Rachel. Sure I liked them together and they had great chemistry but Rachel's angst and BS got to be too much for me which negatively effects the story for me. Do I like this series? Yes but I would have loved it more if Rachel had better more endearing qualities."

 Rebound is book 2 in an ongoing series. I read it as a standalone and didn't feel like it negated my reading experience at all as Noelle August did a great job recapping the gist of what went on in Boomerang. When I have some free reading time I will read this book to get even a bit more from this boomerang gang. 
 In Rebound we have Alison Quick who made a colossal mistake in boomerang but is trying to make up for it in Rebound by getting to know Adam Blackwood for her father as her father may invest in Adam's company. 
 Unbeknownst to each of them they first meet at Halloween party and are instantly attracted to one another and have created some good sexual chemistry but once they find out their true identities they try to cool it but fail at doing so. 
 They both have secrets but can these secrets destroy them??? The more closely they work together the more they are drawn to one another but both have secrets and something to hide. 
 As their connection grows their secrets are edging to come out. For me I thought with such a buildup that these secrets were going to shock me but I have to admit once they all came out I was left with wanting more. After the pivotal climatic point where betrayals are exposed and secrets are out it all of a sudden jumped forward in time with quickly wrapping up all the loose ends. I wanted a bit more rawness after this so I could have felt the angst more at this time but it had a sweet ending even though it was too quickly wrapped up for me. 
 I liked the idea of the story. It was sweet with a bit of angst a douchebag villain and a HEA. At times predictable where others times it was supposed to be a bit more shocking but left me wanting more. However because I wanted to see how it was all going to play out it caused me not to be able to put the book down at times. I liked all the characters at Boomerang and I will be reading more from this series now that I have read this one.

"3.5 Shep Loving Stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Author and Wordsmith Publicity 
 Hmmmmm! Rich boy who gets everything he wants. Girl from the other side of the tracks. A bet and wager with high stakes. 
 This book was a sweet love story about two young people who are from different worlds but totally work together. 
 Shep Prescott is the boy who has it all except that comes with a rude snobby family and a hollowness where the 'one and done' rule is growing tiresome. 
 Jade Frost can be a bit bitchy especially when her boyfriend agrees for her to be collateral for a bet. Now that the bet was lost she's pissed and tells Shep where to go when he tries to claim his prize. 
 Right. Kill your now ex-boyfriend for getting you the opportunity to date Shep? That bet might be the best thing that ever happened to you. 
 Jade's the first girl to truly challenge Shep which makes him changes his 'dawg' ways. However truly winning Jade is not going to be easy with her love/hate relationship she has with him. 
 This book wasn't super angsty filled only with assumptions and miscommunications which I appreciated. It was a refreshing love story with some bumps on the road but nothing to crazy. It was sweet and charming and I'm always a big fan of the 'player' changing his ways when he meets the right girl.

"3.5 Stars!

 What is Normal?? What is Love? These are the two things that Bran and Talia have to face and deal with. 
 For Talia she has some quirks that in some peoples minds aren't normal but what is normal? OCD for some seems so wrong and easily controlled but that is coming from people who have never suffered from these inflictions which makes them ignorant and inpatient. Talia has suffered with this her whole life but it got so much worse with the loss of her sister and the dissolution of her family. 
 What she needs is a fresh start. So what better way than to go to Australia to begin Talia v2.0. 
 Bran has once loved and lost. And being brought up in a household with no love has caused Bran to doubt and not believe in love anymore. So what better way to do this than sleep your way through Australia. 
 At one of Bran's low points he meets a beautiful unique American. The last thing he wants is any feelings for her but there is something about her that he can't stay away from. For Talia she thinks Bran is a jerk but he also has noticed her quirks and has not judged her or treated her differently. If anything its what intrigues him more. 
 Quickly a pseudo awkward friendship starts between these two but escalates to more with a bit of heartache caused by the unfortunate genre favorite angst of assumptions and miscommunications. Bran starts to let Talia in but he still keeps her at arms length and hides stuff from her. Which causes a bit of an issue between them especially with her departure date back to the USA looming closer. 
 These two are a bit of a hot mess but they work because even though Talia has lived through a lot she still believes in love while Bran takes Talia as she is and thinks her imperfections are perfect for him. These two go through some young drama with the help of Talia's neurotic crazy mother which helps us understand the reason Talia has some issues to begin with. 
 At the end of this book we could be satisfied with its pseudo HEA but we all know being young and in love is a bumpy rode so there's more from these two that they will have to go through in books 2 & 3.

"4.5 Compassionate Stars!! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Samhain via NetGalley 
 A convict and a priest walk into a bar .... 
 To some this would be the beginning of a joke but for Lucas and Mark it is a turning point in their lives. 
 Lucas Cain at one time was confused and lost which caused him to get angry and get into fights. On one fight he made a decision that has marked him. He killed a man. He didn't mean to but it still happened. Now after serving three years he's free again. Or is he? 
 Father Mark is a man of God but has let hatred into his soul where it comes to Lucas Cain. A man who killed his brother is now free to walk back into society. Usually Mark is a man on a mission trying to change the church for the better and be there for his parishioners when they need guidance. His specialty to help guide is with sexuality since not only his he a priest but he's also gay. 
 And you just walk around just ... just ... being gay ... 
 I walk I sit I wake I sleep. All gay all day. 
 Lucas has changed but his friends don't want to let go. Now Lucas is stuck in the past but wants to move forward with his future. Sadly his homophobic friends are not on board. Mark is enraged that Lucas is out and enjoying life so every chance he gets he tries to get Lucas back in jail where he belongs. But now his choices are causing reactions that he doesn't feel comfortable with and now he has to own up to his actions. 
 These consequences are now affecting his life as well as his other choices to help others. Not all see what he does at the church as helping but more hindering. 
 Calling the cops doesn't mean you're afraid it means you're above all this shit. You're a priest for fuck's sake. You save people's souls or whatever and the police take care of this stuff. 
 Lucas and Mark need each other to help Alex a young boy who is Lucas's friend and one of Mark's parishioners. A boy who wants to be brave and not be forced to live in the closet to help ease the conscious of others. But by doing this he puts Lucas and Mark in the line of fire. 
 There is fire against them but there is also a fire brewing between them. They are the most unlikely duo but as they get to know each other they are the perfect fit for each other. With these new choices comes more consequences and more hard choices. 
 I'll still serve God. Maybe I'll serve Him better somewhere else. But the church will have lost ... He shrugged. One person. One loyal servant. That's not a big deal. But they'll have lost a chance as well. An opportunity to be an earthly example of God's love and acceptance. To courageously lead the way. 
 This was my first Kate Sherwood book and it definitely will not be the last. It was poignant and beautiful. It's a story about love forgiveness and compassion. The ignorance out there is disheartening to the lgbt community and it breaks my heart as its no one's business what people do in their own homes and their own lives. And for Lucas and Mark they had to bear these burdens but thankfully they triumphed in the end but it didn't mean they came out unscathed. 
 Thankfully not all are filled with hate and these two have a new family now filled with compassion and love.

"4 Engaging Stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Forever (Grand Central Publishing ) via NetGalley & Inkslinger PR 
 Okay! Let's start with first that I love J.L. Berg. And second if you aren't a fan of cliffhangers than I would suggest waiting for book 2 Remembering Everly which comes out April 5/16 because we are left with a doozy of a cliffhanger. 
 I went into this book not knowing too much and I was immediately hooked. Throughout the book we started to unpeel all the layers giving us more and more of the back story between August and Everly. At the beginning I didn't know to love her hate August when I was reading from Everly's POV but when I was reading from August you couldn't help but love him. 
 ~They didn't run after me. They know my routine. I always ran always fled. ~ 
 As for Everly she had many strong points and also some not so flattering points. Normally I don't love heroines who run away at the start of trouble nor heroines who waiver back in forth between me. And Everly had both of these qualities in spades however since we were missing so much of the back story which was a slow build throughout I was able to overlook the qualities for the most part. 
 Now lets talk about Ryan. He was written in a way that you couldn't help but like him. From the choices he made to his actions. But for me I still wanted August more for Everly there emotional bond was too strong to ignore for them and the reader. 
 As we start to get more and more of the story behind August's amnesia and the past secrets you get more hooked but once we finally think things are going to go smoothly the past comes back to haunt both of these two. 
 Took you long enough. 
 Gotta admit I'm so not okay with Everly's decision when faced with her past. Actually now that I think about it more it's how she faces all her decisions. This is when her running gets tiresome. Back and forth and back and forth but never can she just be content with herself. If she was able to do that then she would make way better decisions and choices. She let the past happen by hiding and never really finding out why or what was going on. Now to only repeat the same mistake. 
 Then just as I was getting okay with her decision even though I wasn't happy about it. The secrets all come out leaving us with a whopper of a cliffhanger. Now April feels ions away :( until we get to find out how everyone fairs after the truth and past finally being revealed. 
 Did I like this book? Yes very much as it had me engaged from beginning to end. Will I read more from the series? Yes of course. After that ending you can't NOT read the next book. Am I team Ryan or team August? Team August all the way. As I know there is more behind his behavior and the past but we have to wait to find out what it is in Remembering Everly."
"5 Mal loving stars!! 
 I knew KNEW after reading Lick that I was going to LOVE MAL. And love him I did. Mal Erickson has a bit of a maniac energy about him. Mal has always been on but finally something has shaken Mal but the band doesn't know what it is or how to reach Mal as he keeps pulling away. 
 Anne Rollins is a loyal woman. To her friends and her family. She learned quickly to be a bleeding heart since she was basically forced to raise her little sister when her mom checked out. Anne's so loyal that everyone takes advantage of her generous heart. For the last few years she has had a unrequited on her best friend and boss Reece but he too is one who takes advantage. 
 After the latest friend hurts Anne her neighbor Lauren (Ev's best friend) forces her to come to a party at Ev's house where she runs into the one and only Mal Erickson. The one man who she has crushed on since a teenager. Growing up she has always loved the band Stage Dive and especially the gorgeous drummer Mal. Now that she meets him in person she's a bit star struck. 
 Mal sees a sadness in Anne that he connects with and he wants to get to know her more. Plus what Anne doesn't know is he also needs her. So what a better way then moving in with her after meeting her for about 20 mins. 
 You're a friend of Ev's and Lauren's. We talked. I tackled you. We rolled around on the floor together. It was a real bonding experience. 
 Mal literally moves in with Anne and she can't deny him as he's Mal Erickson and all. Since she always takes care of everyone what is one more? Even though Mal convinces her to be her fake girlfriend he also wants to help Anne aka Pumpkin out. 
 Whatever you want is great. 
 That is so the correct answer. We are going to be the best fake couple ever pumpkin. 
 The friends only agreement between these two doesn't last long and soon after they are bumping uglies with one another. What they didn't expect was to have feelings involved in this sex only encounter. 
 With Mal nothing is sacred. You just have to go with it where he is concerned. If you don't there is no way then you could be with him. That is probably why he has remained single for so long. 
 Too much sex talk in front of friends? I nodded. Sorry said Mal. Real sorry. My bad. 
 The more they get involved the more Anne gets immersed into Mal's life. She starts to see a side that most don't get to see but this vulnerable side of him is also a loose canon. 
 It's fate Anne. Written in the stars. Leave it the fuck alone. 
 When Mal's reason for his sadness comes to light you feel his heartache. You want nothing but to wrap him up and love him. Anne's trying to wade through this mine field with Mal but she has some rough patches. Pumpkin isn't used to a loving supportive family so meeting Mal's and seeing their heartbreak is a new and hard place for Anne. 
 I really like your son  I said. Because I had to say something. So of course it was woefully inadequate as per the ordinary when it came to feelings. 
 I know you do sweetie. I've seen the way you look at him? 
 Crazy eyes? 
 Yes. She laughed softly. Crazy eyes. 
 Once Anne starts to really have feelings for Mal her unrequited crush finally takes notice causing some more bumps for these two but when Anne makes a choice she sticks to it even though not all can see her intentions. Mal's a bit crazy but you can't help but love him. Anne's the perfect combination to balance and ground Mal for better or worse. 
 I LOVED this book! I loved MAL and I love this series. It's such a great combination of heart and humor. Love it!!! And so recommend it.

"4.5 Goodbye Stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of NAL | Penguin Group 
 Ah! The end of a great series. Is always bitter sweet for me. 
 In this last book we get to find out more about Logan whom is Shannon's sister. We met Logan in Echoes in Scotland. And this book starts off a few months after Logan is released from jail. 
 Grace Farquhar can come across a bit prim and proper but really she's just a girl who has a big heart and is super loyal to the people who she deems are family. 
 One thing she hates are confrontations so when her new neighbor is banging his way through Scotland and wrecking her order of things she's finally had enough. 
 I'm sleep deprived and it's all your fault you bloody wretched manwhore. 
 Logan's living his life to the fullest now that he's out of jail. He has great friends a great job and a super supportive loving sister. What more could he want? The minute he runs into Grace she's everything he wants but doesn't think he can have. It's much easier to stick with his lothario ways. 
 Normally Grace is cool and calm but there is something about Logan that sets her off. She thinks she wants nothing to do with him but her friends and Logan's have a different plan for these two. Grace and Logan are not friends they're barely acquaintances but one day a young girl comes upon their doorstep and changes everything. 
 Grace has such a compelling need to help Logan with Maia. It could be because there is a part of her that understands what Maia has gone through but in a very different way. 
 Because I've been where you are-looking for family because the one I was born with let me down in a way you can't forgive. 
 After Maia Logan and Grace are finally friends. To Grace Logan is so much more but her insecurities and doubts cause her not to see what's happening. For Logan once he truly saw the real Grace he knew he wanted her but his past has made him think he couldn't have her. However this doesn't mean he could curb his attraction to her. 
 But you-he shook his head-I can't walk away from you even if I wanted to. And I don't want to. You are reality and sweet oblivion wrapped up in one annoyingly argumentative always-bloody-right classy 
 gorgeous-as-fuck package. 
 Grace and Logan are so super sweet together. I loved them. Thankfully with the help of their friends which is everyone from the On Dublin Street series and some newcomers they help these two realize that they need each other. If it weren't for them these two might have never found their way together. 
 I kind of like you  Logan MacLeod. His grin was wicked and slow. You kind of more than like me Miss Grace Farquhar. 
 Gah! I truly adore this series. From the first to the last it has a special place in my heart. I am sad to see the end but know it has to happen. I thought Grace and Logan were a great way to end the series.

"4. 5 Tyler Loving Stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of NAL | Penguin Group 
 I wasn't sure what to expect upon reading this book. I went in without knowing anything. Without reading any feedback or reviews. And after reading I will say it was amazing. I loved it from beginning to end. 
 Easton Bradbury has a past and a bit of a chip on her shoulder. But that chip is to protect herself. One night at Mardi Gras she meets an intriguing older man actually not that old since Tyler is younger than me but older compared to Easton. This man sparks something within herself but she knows she can't have that so she walks away. 
 After walking away she focuses on her new career of teaching. With this new passion she tries to combine old teaching ways with modern times of social media. With change always comes conflict. Some of that conflict comes from a father of one of her students a father who also happens to be the mystery man as well as a new and up and comer potential US senator. 
 Tyler Marek stole my heart from the very beginning. Easton is also attracted to him but the fact that she's his son's teacher makes this new possibility a no go. The beauty about Tyler is the pure honesty of him. The fact that he knows where he has screwed up then he owns up to it and then goes to change things. Especially where it comes to his son. He's also trying to balance everything else within his life like his business as well as the upcoming campaign. 
 Tyler's also intrigued by Easton especially since she does the complete opposite to every other female he knows. The fact that she portrays a certain dislike or indifference to him irks him the most but he can't stop being attracted to her 
 I like you a lot and I don't know why because you're fucking miserable to me half the time he mused. You rarely smile. You never laugh but you love to argue and for some reason I want you around. I want you to know things about me and I like telling you shit. Why do I feel like I'm in the wrong here? 
 Tyler and Easton both have a lot to learn. And together they bring out the best in each other but being together is very risky and a lot of things can be destroyed with this relationship. Each character was developed so amazingly that you were able to completely relate and understand each of them. 
 For Easton her past helps define her but it's also her chains. Once she can get free of that she will be able to excel forward. At 23 it's not considered completely young but in comparison to Tyler it is young with their 12 year age difference. Normally insecure woman drive me batty and near the end Easton was on the verge of me starting to dislike her but then I was able to step back and realize that for sure she will be insecure as they are worlds apart and she's a girl in a man's world. I felt Penelope was able to capture these emotions spot in within the context of their relationship. 
 For Tyler his conflict is real and he tries to find the balance but his ego and want for power get in the way. He has to find what truly means the most to him to be able to have everything that he wants. 
 There were so many elements to this book. Their pasts. Their present. Their passions. Their wants and desires. Their need for each other. Their struggles. Coping mechanisms. Christian. The students. Her teaching style. The campaign. A mystery that you are trying to figure out which we can't completely till we have the whole picture. As well as a beautiful love story filled with heart and passion. 
 Did I love this book? Hell yeah! Do I recommend it? Yes! Favorite Part? Tough choice but I think it has to go to Tyler. He makes and completes the book. There is just something about him that you can't help but fall in love with him. Tyler and Easton as a couple? Amazing. Even though there might be an age difference between them it just works for them. They are the complete balance to one another. 
 Loved it!!"
"3 It's got potential stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of St. Martin's Press 
 I absolutely adored the Stage Dive series so I had huge expectations going into this book. Which was my first mistake. I know better than that. If I have no expectations I tend to like the books more. When I go in with huge expectations and they aren't met it tends to ruin my reading experience. 
 With Dirty I liked the idea and concept of the book more than the story itself. And sadly the book had more sex than substance at times. 
 However when the book did catch me it was with the witty banter between Lydia and Vaughn 
 Whatever. You're looking a bit homicidal over there. Everything okay? 
 I just want you to know I will not be falling slave to your devil dick and demon tongue. No matter how good they are. 
 The book starts with Lydia literally running away from a bad decision and landing herself into the bathroom of a savior. Vaughn may not seem like a savior but he was the balm to Lydia's sadness and Lydia was the light to Vaughn's future. It was cute and sexy but to me I was wanting more from the story. 
 Did I like this book? Yes I just didn't love it. Does this series have potential? Yes and I will read more of it when it gets released. Was Vaughn and Lydia memorable? Not completely since its been a few weeks since I read this and I'm having a bit of a hard time recalling my feelings for them.

"4 Dark but yet healing Stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy from Berkley | Penguin Group via NetGalley 
 If you liked Willing Victim by Cara McKenna then you will like this book. This book was really good but it took me awhile to get completely engaged with it. I don't know if I wasn't originally in the mood or what. With darker themes you have to be in the right head space to truly enjoy the experience. It take a bit for me but eventually I was hooked and fell in love with Jonah and Vivienne. 
 Since a teenager Vivienne has craved a dark sexual need but hasn't found anyone willing to fulfill it for her. This need-it drives her it torments her it haunts her. After being publicly out for her darkest desires she finds comfort in a dark stranger. A stranger that wakes up things she didn't know even existed. A stranger who also shares just as dark as a need. 
 ~ The harm is when the lines between reality and fantasy get blurred. Like they did last night. ~ 
 Jonah has his own issues but finds a match in Vivienne. Quickly but safely these two embark on a journey to give each other what they need. 
 It's your fantasy and mine. Chances like this don't come along often-two people twisted in the exact same way. 
 Even though Vivienne is filled with tons of shame for her wants she knows something about this feels also right. 
 ~ That ought to scare the shit out of me except-he's right. I do want to play rough. I want the dirtiest filthiest brutality and I want it badly. Wanted it for so long.~ 
 With these desires also causes vulnerability. There's a very slippery slope where these two are concerned. They both know what they need but they don't know each others whys. 
 I just want to ask why. In my experience the answers to questions like that usually fail to satisfy. 
 This whole fantasy/reality line is a journey for Vivienne. But a healing journey. Finally she has found her equal. Her match. Someone who believes her. 
 ~These days I don't hate myself for having been raped. I hate myself for wanting to act it out all over again. ~ 
 Just because they need each other also doesn't make it right. 
 No. But don't you see? I don't just fuck you Jonah. I bare my soul to you. . .  
 The more they play the more the line gets crossed. The more the inner torment seeps in. 
 The best move is not to answer him now or ever. 
 I click reply. 
 Because of their needs it makes this relationship to so much more than it was originally supposed to be. 
 Really you only know one important thing about me. But the one thing you know is the simple most intimate private thing I've ever shared with anyone. That's why I said I bared my soul to you every time. That's why this relationship feels like -  
 Now trying to decide to have their desires met as well as being honest with their emotions is tough on both of them. This is not an easy relationship to begin with and they're both walking on a live volcano of emotions and feelings. 
 Exactly. The fantasy isn't your problem it's the extremity of your fixation on it. Who is it who won't let you find sexual satisfaction any other way? 
 The truth of the past comes out. It's not a pretty past. It's dark and sad. But it's also the bond that holds these two together. Can they find their way to a lighter future together? Or are they going to be chained by their dark pasts? Only time will tell and now we have to wait till September to see if these two can make a real relationship between them.

 This book is raw heavy heartbreaking and beautiful. Elizabeth Finn has done it again with another amazing heart wrenching story. This is such a hard review to write because this is a story that you need to experience on your own. Instead of one of my traditional reviews I'm going to try and communicate with quotes from the books and emotions triggered. 
 I want all of you regardless of the fact I deserve nothing from you. Things can't go on this way with us. It's tearing me apart. I put myself in your life because I wanted to see who you were now. 
 HURT 
 ... But don't ask me a question unless you want the honest answer because you're going to get the truth however ugly it is upsetting it is or shocking it is. 
 ANGUISH 
 I've missed you so fucking much he said quietly. Nothing has made sense in my life without you. 
 LOSS 
 Please don't make me a bad memory. Let me be a good one. 
 HOPE 
 I am always going to love you Hell. And you will always have a place in my world if you want one. But your disappointment in me hurts. It's completely valid but if fucking hurts. And that's not going to end. There are things in my past I can't expect you to cope with. I can't ... 
 TORMENT 
 You're the brightest warmest star in my universe I whispered. You will never be less than everything to me. I pulled back studying her eyes. You're my Hell. 
 AGONY 
 I'm not good at much in this world. 
 But I'm good at loving you 
 WANT 
 Of course my walk brought me here. Everything in my life seems to bring me to you. 
 NEED 
 I'm just trying to figure out how to deserve you Helene. 
 HEARTBREAK 
 I want to be a part of you I whispered. You are a part of me she whispered back. You always have been. 
 PASSION 
 I need your forgiveness. 
 DESPAIR 
 Sometimes nothing is enough-not even everything. 
 SAD 
 We deserved a better life than this. 
 REDEMPTION 
 You were my flower too she whispered. My warmth in the cold my beautiful thing in all the ugly. You don't have to be afraid of this. 
 COMPLETION 
 This book has a tragic dark story but so worth the read and very recommended. It's a hard heavy journey but with a very beautiful ending. There is always light in the dark and beauty within the ugly and this book portrays it so well.

 Damn you Jewel E. Ann. I just want to read a couple of chapters before bed but they I was HOOKED and I ended up staying up all night long because I could NOT put the book down. :) 
 I LOVED this book! It had intrigue angst humor drama passion and loads of love. 
 Darby Carmichael comes from a political family whom expects a lot out of her. Her mom has past leaving a void where her step monster never filled it. Could be because she's a superficial bitch or because they are close in age which makes it awkward. Thankfully she's still super close to her Nana. She's great at her job at the hospital she even loves it. But she's stuck. She's dating a family approved boyfriend but she really doesn't like him all that much. It's just easy. 
 Then one day she goes into an exam room and her whole world changes. 
 Patrick 'Trick' Roth is a make up artist and 'gay'. He doesn't like woman but he doesn't know why. All he knows his that he has a great 'partner' and best friend and that he loved his parents but lost them when he was a teenager so he's been on his own for a long time. He started with nothing but has made something of himself. Sadly he still feels like he is missing something but doesn't know what. 
 Then one day he cuts himself and needs stitches. He goes to the hospital and his whole world changes. 
 Fate is on their side and these two meet again but this time Trick isn't as friendly. After being a bit of a douche Darby has to set him straight for him to only get more intrigued by this woman. Eventually these two become fast friends. Because of Darby's upbringing she's never really had a best friend and with Trick being gay he's a safe bet. It just sucks that he's so gorgeous. 
 The closer they get the more complicated it gets between them especially when Darby falls in love with her 'gay' best friend. 
 Because I no longer need a reminder of where I've been ... I have you to remind me of where I'm going and when I'm with you I don't ever want to look back. 
 These two need each other but it's getting tricky and emotions are on the line. Then after the biggest bombshell Darby has to come to term with the truth and what it means. 
  ... the gay masquerade has been a symbiotic relationship between Trick and him for years. So even if Trick decides he's ready to come out of the reverse gay closet Grady still needs his decoy. 
 For Trick its always been easy to hide under an assumption but with Darby he wants more. He wants everything. 
 I'm not going to stop until I feel your soul take my last breathe. 
 As Darby and Trick get closer she brings him home to only have it all blow up in their faces and for Trick's past to start to creep to the forefront. Sadly Trick doesn't know his past to see it happen. No matter what anyone else thinks they know what they want and are willing to make it work. 
 A book with blank pages weathered edges and eraser marks that's what I am. I need you to paint my future write my story in permanent marker just like the mark you left on my heart the day we met. Your touch is the only thing I feel your voice the only thing I hear your face the only thing I see but your love ... your love my beauty is the only thing I need. 
 Finally these two can have some happiness after suffering more tragedy but really the true heartache was just hiding around the corner and then their whole world blows apart. Trick knows what he wants but can Darby and himself get over his past. 
 I know you can't forget so if you're going to remember something remember this. You fucking own Every. Single. Piece. Of . Me. His voice breaks our mouths a breath away. I love you. I live for you. I fucking breathe for you. That's what you need to remember ... only that. 
 Gah! This was a refreshing twist within this friends to lover genre. I loved it! I adored Trick! and even though you have a feeling of what's to come you keep crossing your fingers hoping it's not the case. When we finally find out the truth it ends up being so much more then we anticipated. Great book! This was my first Jewel E. Ann book but after this it will definitely won't be my last.

"3.5 I adore Gavin Stars!! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Williams Morrow via Edelweiss 
 When I first started to read this book it didn't immediately catch me. I even had times that I contemplated a DNF but I'm stubborn and finished it and I'm glad that I did. The set up for the story is a country band with brother sister and best friend. The potential relationship is between the sister and best friend but of course the brother is against this idea leaving the couple in forbidden situation. 
 Sometimes 
 ... sometimes pain is a good thing Gavin. His eyes widen and I lower 
 myself onto him relieved that he's as turned on as I am right now. 
 Sometimes it's the only way to make sure that you're still alive. 
 I felt the angst but at times I felt the book long and at times unnecessary for the build up but these parts could be build up for the next books (We will see). Since the moment Dixie Lark met Gavin Garrison she fell head over heels in love. For Gavin he had a tough childhood and needs this band and friendship so he keeps his feelings for Dixie aside. Dixie has tried to keep her feelings at bay but she can't deny them any more. 
 Dixie and Dallas too have had a rough childhood but they had each other and their grandparents. What they know is love and loyalty. Can Dixie love Gavin enough for the two of them??? As Dixie convinces Gavin for just one night. One night to feed the fire. Hopefully this will settle her feelings and she can finally douse the flames. If she can't this night may ruin the band and their friendship. 
 For all three of them music is the only thing that makes them alive and full. Dixie wants the band but she wants Gavin more. Because at times I think Dixie may be daft she doesn't see Gavin's heart or conflict so she pushes and pushes him. 
 Do you even know how precious you are to me? 
 You've wrecked me Bluebird. I. Am. Wrecked. 
 As Gavin finally gives in Dixie starts to realize she wants so much more. Now faced with a new reality with the potential new success of the band there are changes on the forecast. Their new manager is a manipulative bitch and is determined to break the band. Dixie is young broken and insecure so she is the easiest link to sever. 
 Now add loss her brothers stance on Gavin NOT being with Dixie and more heartbreak for this young girl and she's officially lost. 
 Can there really ever be an us Gavin? Kind of sounded like you and my brother have already decided against it. Guess I didn't get a vote. 
 Dixie's young and thinks she's making the right choice being a martyr but what will be the consequences? She loves Gavin with everything but she knows he has a past and many secrets. So if she can give him a chance of happiness she is determined to let him go. 
 Now faced with nothing Dixie decides to embark on a journey to discover herself while Gavin realizes what he's lost and has to find his way back to her. But after he cleans up his past. 
 You have me Bluebird. You've always had me. 
 Warning... there is a slight cliffhanger in the end and we are left waiting to find out what all of Gavin's secrets are and hoping that Gavin and Dixie can find their way back to one another. Now with book two it looks like its going to be more centered on Dallas so I don't know if we will find Dixie and Gavin's HEA in book 2 or if we will have to agonizingly have to wait for book 3. 
 I was so glad that I conquered through and finished this book and finally got into the emotional drama of these two and now I can't wait for more.

"3.5 Tortured Stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of William Morrow via Edelweiss 
 Finally the HEA 
 ending to the story of Gavin Garrison and Dixie Lark. After the ending of Leaving Amarillo we are left waiting for Gavin and Dixie to get their shit together so they can finally be together. Then book two is Dallas's book which prolongs the wait for Gavin and Dixie 
 Within stories we find many damaged characters but poor Gavin takes it to a whole new level. As much as I understood his brokenness I also at times just wanted him to grow a pair and take what he wants and needs. Instead he tortures himself to the extreme until he finally gets it through his thick head that he too deserves some happiness and goodness in his life. 
 ~I am still a wreck of a human being. I'm still a lost hungry 
 fucked-up kid confused about the way the world works and where I belong 
 in it. ~ 
 ~I don't deserve her.~ 
 ~She is capable of so many things so much more than being held back by a bartender with a record and a junkie for a mom. ~ 
 ~Dixie deserves so much better than this.~ 
 Don't get me wrong Dixie too can hold a mean grudge as well as she has her own baggage. So between these two it was quite the journey for them to find themselves back together. 
 Dixie Lark has always loved Gavin but enough is enough already where he is concerned. Especially when she finds out that he didn't go on tour and is working down the road from her without any notice at all. 
 ~ Life doesn't always turn out how you expect and sometimes parts of you get broken along the way but there is always hope and even broken pieces can be rebuilt into something beautiful. My heart is a piece of mosaic art at this point. ~ 
 Gavin has a plan but not a well thought out plan where it comes to Dixie's emotions. 
 ~Damn it. In my quest to get my shit together I've all but shut her 
 out of my life completely. It seemed like the best idea for everyone 
 involved but now I'm wondering if I've made a colossal mistake.~ 
 But Gavin's poor tortured soul is playing havoc with him. He know what he wants but is trying to be what she needs. If only he realized that all she needed was him then there would have been so much less heartache for these two. 
 ~ She is perfection personified and in my heart she's mine. Always has been always will be.~ 
 Instead of talking these two take the cake with assumptions and miscommunications. 
  . . . But this game you are playing you and Dixie she clarifies. It won't end well if you aren't honest with each other. 
 Am I? Because if memory serves that girl was pretty honest about what she wanted. It's this new one that seems to keep her true feelings on lockdown. But that's why I came by. 
 Thankfully this stubborn duo have people at their back to help guide them to where they need to be. 
 Gavin has demons little sister. He just does. He battles them every day and some days he doesn't win. I know you love him and I am your brother and it's my natural instinct to protect you. 
 And then with the help of another broken boy these two find their way back to each other. 
 I love you Gavin. Bigger than your mistakes and bigger than the pain you cause me. 
 It's this beautiful tortured man in front of me that I want more than I want air or water or food. 
 I know Gavin. I know you better than you think I do. I want all of you. The light and the dark and the broken parts. I am all broken parts he says into my ear. That's all I am. We are all broken. That's how the light gets in 
 Gah! These two went on quite the painful journey to find their happiness but it was so worth it in the end. Sure could I have had less of the stubbornness and brokenness but it's also what makes their story so tragic yet beautiful. 
 Tell me what you want Bluebird 
 You she answers softly. All I've ever wanted or needed is you Gavin. Just you. 
 It's a bit bittersweet to see the end of this story but it feels complete. Especially with the unconventional HEA but so perfect for these two. 
 ~I don't know why it took me so long to see why I got caught up in the short term and failed to see how powerful what we had was or the kind of future our love is capable of providing. ~"
"4 I love Drew Stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy from Author 
 After reading J Nathan's debut book Until Alex (which I really liked) getting the chance to read Since Drew I jumped at the chance to review it. In Since Drew it's based on two totally new characters Andi Parker and Drew Slater. 
 Andi Parker has had one dream and that's to run in the Olympics. 
 Drew Slater has had everything come easier to him but it hasn't always been what he truly wanted. 
 One moment in both of their lives drastically changes everything. 
 After Andi finds herself in the hospital broken physically and mentally with her dreams shattered she befriends a fellow hospital mate named Drew. The two quickly become close and help push each other to heal and move forward. 
 When things seem to be moving in the right direction all of a sudden a mind twist happens and makes us doubt everything that has already happened. I had a feeling I knew what was going to happen and why (which I was correct in guessing) but it didn't change my experience in reading it. 
 Andi's now confused and heartbroken. 
 Drew's now for the first time feeling something that he has never felt before.... hope. 
 Two wrongs don't make a right but for these two it sure does. I loved Drew even when he was being an ass. I fell for him right from the get go. Andi was strong and resilient and together they pushed each other that they couldn't have done without the other. 
 Thank you J Nathan for something refreshing and new in this very formulaic genre. The story was great. The twist was refreshing. The angst was heartfelt. The bond between the two was solid and strong. The whole thing was great from start to finish.

"4.5 Chuckle filled stars!! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Amazon Publishing via NetGalley 
 Gah! I loved it! It has been forever since I had a book that I laughed or chuckled the whole way through. Truthfully the Bet series may have been the last time. This book is exactly what I needed. So often in the romance genre the books all start to sound the same and at times I get jaded because I want something fresh and new. In The Consequences of Loving Colton yes it is a similar story line with the brother's best friend and the little sister but with all the shenigans and humor it ended up being new and fun to read. 
 Unrequited love sucks! Milo has always loved Colton but she's the tomboy little sister who has never gotten the attention of her older brothers best friend. 
 Colton has always loved Milo but was scared to lose her as a friend if it wasn't returned as well as didn't want to go there with his best friend. 
 Max is Milo's best friend and wingman 
 Reid is Max's brother 
 Jayne is Satan. 
 Jason is the brother and accident prone when his sister is around. 
 Grandma's a horndog. 
 Now you combine all these elements together and you got a great fun humor filled story. 
 Colton's fighting his feelings while Milo is lying to protect her heart. 
 I'd rather fight with you bicker with you every dam day of my life than have nothing at all. I'm selfish enough to want any piece of you-even if it's the bad the ugly the ridiculous. So even if you hated me I'd still die a happy man-because I'd still be on your mind. 
 It wasn't an easy journey for the princess and her knight but it was a worthwhile fun journey to find their bit of HEA. 
 Gush! I adored this book.

"3.5 Very Sweet Stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Author and Wordsmith Publicity 
 I'm always a big fan of Tammara Webber and think she's the cat's ass when it comes to NA. I loved the other two books in the Contour of the Heart series so I couldn't wait for this one and see how good ol' Boyce fairs in love. 
 Boyce has had nothing but shit luck in his young years but what he does have is one shining moment. The moment he saves little Pearl's life. 
 Pearl has overcome a lot with the help of her mother. So the last thing she wants is to disappoint her. But she's having a hard time following her dreams when they don't match her mother's. 
 When are you going to stop being afraid to live your life Pearl? 
 Pearl is trying to make her own but the one constant she has is her friend Boyce. Because Boyce saved her life they have a special bond but that's not all they share. 
 But sometimes what seems like a gut feeling is just pride pretending to be instinct. 
 Boyce and Pearl want the same thing but they both keep assuming which leads to miscommunication and heartache. But it's easier to assume then think you deserve happiness. Especially when you never have truly had it. 
 Love you? Oh hell yeah. When I pulled you out of that ocean you woke up and stared up at me like I was worth something. I fell for you right then and there. You're the only woman I've ever loved Pearl. It's you for me or no one. 
 Once Boyce and Pearl get on the same page their love is sweet. Finally two great people can get what they deserve love and happiness. It was just a bumpy road getting there. 
 Take what you want from me then. It's been yours all along. 
 I did quite like the book but at times angsty miscommunication drives me batty when a whole bunch of heartache could have been prevented when there wasn't assumptions and miscommunications. I'm such a sucker for books about second chances hope and friends to lovers and Sweet fit the bill.

"4.5 Loved it Stars!!! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Samhain Publishing via NetGalley 
 I can't believe this but this was my first Barbara Elsborg book that I have read. 
 I know I know. How did this happen? After reading this book let me tell you that this definitely won't be the last. I loved it!!!! The writing was great. The story was amazing. It's one of those stories that hooks you in and stays with you for a long time afterwards. 
 Harper has just been set free from a crime that he didn't commit. And now he has to readjust to living in the real world again after being a bit broken from being in prison and wrongly accused. 
 Malachi is down in his luck and just wants a break. Malachi's mouth gets the best of sometimes causing him to not always get the opportunities he deserves but his heart is always in the right place. 
 Once chance sighting and Malachi fell but what are the chances he will ever see Harper again. 
 Fate is on both their sides and they find themselves officially meeting and wanting more. They both instantly fall but Harper is a bit skittish. Malachi and his loose tongue have help Harper trust and open up. Once Harper gives Malachi is biggest secret scared that he will run but so pleasantly surprised when not only does he believe him but wants to go to bat for him as well. 
 Harper's story is a heartbreaking one that you just feel for him and all that he has lost. You just route for him to have any slice of happiness especially where Malachi is concerned. It's been 10 years for Harper but he wants Malachi badly. Now that the secret is out Harper can fall more. Their tentative relationship was great. I loved the chemistry and dialogue between these two. There is just something perfectly matched between these two. 
 Malachi wants so badly to clear Harper that he reaches to his past to help win Harper his freedom. Harper used to think he wanted his freedom but once falling for Malachi he realizes that that love is enough for him. Unfortunately Harper's ex is not getting the picture and trying to make Harper's life hell while Malachi's ex boss is also trying to destroy Harper's house. These two already had an uphill battle but now you add all this nonsense and its start to be a rough road for each other. Thankfully they have each other. 
 They both can't fall anymore but the past and present are colliding causing tons of havoc for these two. With everything on the line they both have to give up something to find their HEA. 
 Falling is easy. Landing without breaking your heart? Impossible. 
 This book was great. I love books that are carefully layered with different elements going on but flawlessly come together. This layering creates so much more depth to a story instead of the only angst being about the couple. Instead the other layers help to deepen the connection while adding suspense and intrigue to the story to get the reader so captured that they can't put the book down. 
 Great Couple. Great Story. Great Dialogue. Amazing Book!

"4.5 Bloody Brilliant Stars!!! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Riptide Publishing via NetGalley 
 I LOVED IT! It was a bit of an unconventional romance but it so worked. 
 Tom has been in love with Cass forever. What works for these two is an open relationship. Especially because both of these guys work way too much. Since they can't always be there for each other this relationship works for them. 
 Tom has a huge heart and has helped pull Cass through a tough time in his life. But Cass still has his demons and Tom doesn't know how to help him. What he can focus on is their businesses which always helps him when he feels lost with Cass. 
 One normal day during a location scout Tom comes across Jake who reminds him so much of Cass but is so much more. Jake and Tom instantly hit it off. Well until Jake is left in the apartment for Cass to find. 
 And he didn't say much at all apart from calling me an arse-bandit wanker which I thought was pretty rich. Why? What am I missing? 
 At this point in most conventional romance books we would be squirming with the potential cheating but we get to understand this relationship between Tom and Cass that we're able to swallow this detail and cheer them all on. 
 Cass knows that he can't give Tom everything so he strongly urges Tom to have Jake apart of his life. 
 I'm saying stay here and be what he needs. You've got a big heart babe. There's plenty of you to go around. 
 Jake. Gah! I LOVE him. He is perfect with is tics and quirks that belong to his Tourette's syndrome. I think this part of his character made him so more endearing. Jake doesn't want to come in between these two especially after seeing them together but he also can't seem to stay away. As Cass pushes Tom and Jake closer he also befriends Jake in a different way. As their relationships progress Jake comes more and more entwined in their relationship and life. 
 Looking back Jake would be able to pinpoint the exact moment when the disjointed desire between the three of them fell into place. 
 Since this is so new for all of them it takes some time for them to find their footing. Yes Tom and Cass have had an open relationship but never have they had a third come into their relationship before. 
 We fuck other people because it suits is to do it but if you're freaking out about that you should know neither of us has looked at another bloke since you came along. You've put a spell on Tom and I'm not far behind. 
 Tom and Cass loved each other. You feel their strength and bond but they also let work become an road block within their relationship. They didn't even know what was missing until Jake became the bridge to fully unite them together. 
 This was my first Garret Leigh book. *Gasp* But after this it soooo won't be my last. I can NOT wait to read more from the fabulous author. I absolutely adored this book and so recommend it.

"4.5 Brave is the new bad Stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Harper Collins via Edelweiss 
 There is no regret Reeve and there is no choice. Right or wrong you are it for me. You get all the parts of me. You make me feel like I can just be me not a cop not a big brother not a hero not a savior . . . just a man. A man that has his good and bad parts. I'll never be perfect but for you I will always be real and you can always be just who you are with me. . . .  
 Finally Titus's story. Poor Titus torn between right and wrong in the Point. 
 I can't tell the difference anymore between the bad guys and the good guys that are bad because they don't have any other choice in the matter. I'm not compromising I'm adapting. Isn't that the first rule of survival? 
 I love this series where some of the people aren't bad per se but do bad things. For Titus he's on the other end trying to be good and do the right thing but in the Point there is a very fine line. Reeve sold part of her soul to get revenge putting her on the other side of the line. But for Titus he's intrigued enough to want to cross the line where Reeve is concerned. 
 You shouldn't be what makes me feel good Reeve. 
 Poor Titus such internal conflict. But Reeve has her own battle with right and wrong. 
 You're trying to save everyone I just wanted to save the one person that mattered to me. It's different. 
 Reeve has always wanted Titus but never thought she was good enough. 
 She's made some bad decisions in her past but now needs Titus for so 
 much more. But are her intentions honest or is she using our poor loving Titus? 
 As Titus needs Reeve to stop the war he also finds he needs her for so much more. The scales of right and wrong are different in the Point especially when you are related to the bad. 
 I needed Bax to remind me that sometimes the bad guys weren't bad because they wanted to be they were that way because they didn't have any other choice. 
 Titus is always taking care of everyone as its his job and his passion but for the first time he has someone actually wanting to take care of him. 
 Take care of yourself Detective. Or better yet get home in one piece so I can take care of you. 
 How do you fall in love when your part of the world is dark and at war? 
 We take care of each other. That's what love in this place looks like. You have each other's back. 
 I absolutely adore Jay Crownover and everything she has written but I especially love this series where lines are drawn in pencil and there is good and bad on both sides. It's a darker world to some but you can only be kick ass and strong to survive in it. I loved Titus's conflict and his passion. Reeve was perfect for him and a great representation of a woman of strength in a place like the Point. Where sometimes you have to do bad things to survive but doesn't mean you have a bad heart. I can't wait for more from this series and anything by Jay Crownover. 
 If you like the bad being bad but with big hearts and a life a bit more shady but hopeful then this series is perfect for you.

"4 Drama Filled Stars!!! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy from Author 
 Every day since I read Here with me I have been foaming at the bit to read this story and find out what happens with Evan Ryley and Nate. 
 At the end of Here with Me we are left with confusion of Nate and what all this means for this trio. Now in Choose Me we get to find out what happens. Evan has been wronged by the Navy and he's lost everything that means anything to him. Now that Nate is back Ryley is back to not knowing who to choose as she loves both of these men. 
 If Evan can't have Ryley the way he wants then at the least he wants to be the father to his son. In Here with Me Evan Junior gets told that Evan is his father but what Evan needs is for Nate to tell him to reiterate this fact and let his son know that he is his true father. 
 Nate loves Ryley and Evan junior but he also loves his brother. He doesn't know how to fix this scenario and have everything work out for everyone. 
 Even though the brothers may be on different sides what they do agree on is their love for Ryley and Evan Junior. But that doesn't mean they aren't going to play dirty to get what they want. 
 Ryley is just plain confused. I have to admit I LOVE this story but her wishy washy ways did drive me a bit batty at times. I think the reason I had a problem with it is because I had a clear winner in my mind the whole time. So when she wasn't on the same wave length as me I started to get frustrated because not only was she hurting me with her indecision she was also hurting Evan and Nate. 
 I know she's afraid of hurting Nate but her indecisiveness is slowly killing me. (me too) 
 This love triangle drama could have been enough of a story but no it was so much more. So many facets combined had me staying up all night to finish this book so I could find out what happened. And what a story it was. There were a few loose ends that didn't get answered but no worries there is more to come from this series according to Goodreads. 
 This book had so much angst and drama between the triangle and the navy cover up that I was hooked. I can't say too much about what happens because then it would ruin the reading experience but this series is definitely worth a read. I love romance and suspense combos as the story has so much more depth then just the whole book being based on relationship angst. 
 Great Story. Great Series. Highly recommended.

"4 Kinky and sweet Stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Author and Social Butterfly PR 
 Genre: Adult Kinky Contemporary Sports Romance 
 Standalone 
 My Hardball Review . . . 
 This felt so different than the other CD Reiss's books that I have read and that could be a good thing or not a good thing but in this case it was a good thing. It was a bit different but still had that kinky edge and I freaking loved it! 
 Dash Wallace. Is a man that's bent not broken. He's an adult male living with ADHD in a very stressful world of professional baseball. Most athletes already have their own rituals and superstitions but add the need for routine and control amplify Dash's issues. 
 I didn't know how to exist inside my own contradictions. 
 Vivian Foster. A woman with a huge heart. A librarian working in an underprivileged school. She not only helps the students but gives as much of herself to the students as well. She has an amazing father whom has taught her the value of love but when it comes to relationship she's a bit naive only truly having one past relationship which wasn't a great one to boot. For her she feels like a super ordinary woman so why would super star Dash Wallace want anything to do with her? 
 The moment Dash meets Vivian he's intrigued but he doesn't know how a hometown woman would fit into his very regimented routine. Thankfully fate has stepped in and brought Vivian back into his life when one of his needs has been altered. At first Vivian's on the job to help Dash but these two are pulled together making both of them live outside of their comfort zones. 
 I didn't shave or anything. 
 You're supposed to have hair sweetapple. You're past puberty. 
 These two may seem like opposites but Dash brings the adventurous sexual side out of Vivian where Vivian brings back the luck that Dash thinks he needs. 
 In hindsight I was crazy. At the time though I was getting control of my life. Being proactive. Solving problems. Fixing what was broken. All of those phrases seemed sensible when put next to what I was doing. 
 Relationships are about communication and compromise and for Dash this is all new for him. Vivian wants to please Dash but is losing part of herself worth it? Vivian tries to help Dash to realize that he doesn't need luck he just has to believe in himself but that lesson is hard for him to learn. 
 At first Dash thinks his past routines are enough but letting go of Vivian may have been the worst thing he could have done. 
 Where did Mr. Charming go? 
 That guy didn't have staying power. 
 But Mr. Irritating? He'll stick around? 
 Unfortunately. Go up to the top please. 
 Once realizing that he's made the biggest mistake of his life Dash has to find a way to have Vivian and his routine for baseball. But will Vivian agree to this new routine? Dash has a lot to learn when it comes to relationships. Sure he's amazing in the sack but there's more than sex and rituals. Vivian wants Dash but doesn't want to lose herself but how does she get Dash to realize that he's not taking what's important to Vivian into consideration for their lives together? 
 There's no center without you. 
 I adored this book. It was sexy yet sweet. It was raw and a bit quirky. Sure Hardball is another sports romance but it had a different feel for it and I loved the angle of what made Dash be Dash. It was an evolution of self and the lesson of compromise and communication. I loved Dash and Vivian together. The just fit together. I love their connection and love of literature. Sure at times I wanted to throttle Dash for not seeing outside his little box but I was so happy when he finally saw the light. There was just something that I adored about this book."

 With this title alone I had to read it. After reading it I ended up liking the idea more than the actual book but I was left curious enough to continue with the series. Sometimes books get better as the series go and other times it's the opposite effect we will see. 
 Here we have Hailey Reid who is unfortunately part of an effed up family. Being part of this family means she gets pulled in to all of their schemes with negative effects to her life. 
 I'm just Hailey Reid who had the misfortune to be born into a fucked up family. 
 We also have Cole Parker who is an ex-Navy whose new job is to help people get out of sticky situations which is why he works for the Reid Family. 
 Hailey associates Cole with the negative part of her family but it doesn't mean she's blind. Cole hates the fact that Hailey intrigues him when he can't have her because she deserves better. (Grrrrr over done theme that I'm not a fan of ). With them coming from different sides it has caused them to be angry at one another. This anger has turned into carnal attraction that soon can't be denied between these two. 
 The next hour passes by 
 in an angry blur. It's like there's a slideshow of our kiss playing 
 over and over again in my head with an awful National Graphic 
 narration. The alpha male ever alert for an opportunity to rut with a willing female pounces at the first sign of vulnerability. 
 As they give into their attraction you realize that Cole is hiding parts of his life but you aren't sure what it is but then we get to the end cliffhanger and I was left a bit confused because I didn't see the story going in that direction. It felt like the story needed more tension besides sexual tension that this part just got thrown in. I assume that is not the case and there is reason for this but it felt a bit out of no where. 
 This series has potential but does not yet have me 100% sold on it. It did have sexual tension but sometimes it came across more comical which I don't know was the goal or not. It has set a foundation with a dysfunctional family and loads of secrets so who knows how it will all play out. Even though I'm not completely sold I will continue with it to see how it all plays out. March 24/15 is when we will get part two to this story. 
  I'm pretty sure the fucked up track record of my family guarantees I'm going to have to see you again.

"4. 5 Beauty in the darkness stars! 
 I've been a bit of a funk lately with reading and thankfully this book ensnared me from beginning to end. Kisa Volkova has always known who her soulmate was but he was taken from her young. This loss caused her to make poor choices but dutiful ones. Now that she knows she's missing her other half she ends up being engaged to a huge asshole Alik Durov. She knows what she has with Alik. It isn't healthy but she's fulfilling her role. Until 818 appears. 
 I've seen too many bad things with these eyes. This I will feel in my heart. 
 818 knows two things. 1) to kill to survive and 2) revenge. After most of his life in the dungeon 818 finally has a chance to escape and get his revenge. 
 Ignore it. Control your anger. Kill first live later. Then get the girl. 
 The minute Kisa meets 818 she's drawn to him. She's doesn't know why but she can't seem to stay away. Now the problem is she's still with Alik? However once she finds out who 818 is she now has to decide between her duty or her heart. 
 He will have you Kisa. You saw his soul yet you didn't recognize his face. And he knew you even when his memories were not there. You are his light his guide back to this life. 
 Did I love this book? YES!!! It was dark but heartwarming. 818 is so damaged and broken but his heart is so pure. His struggles to find himself are heartfelt and raw. But the true beauty in this book is the bond between Kisa and 818. It knows no end. It's strong and real. 
 Nothing will ever happen to her sir. She's my everything . . . she's the reason I live . . . breath . . . exist. She's my entire world. There's no safer place for her than being beside me. 
 This book is so much darker than Tillie's Sweet Home series but the heart is still there. In this book the beauty is in the darkness. I loved it and recommend it. Now I can't wait for more."
"3.5 Too Loyal stars!! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Gallery Books and Sullivan and Partners via NetGalley 
 This is another book that I had mixed reviews on. I liked the concept and story. I loved Malcolm Saint. But there were parts that drove me bat shit crazy. 
 Rachel's a girl who has dreams and ambitions. She's loyal (too loyal) and dedicated. So when she gets the chance of a life time she jumps on it. This story can change her life and career. But doing an expose on the Chicago's most successful bachelor and manwhore might come with a surprise. 
 Malcolm Saint is a bit of an enigma. He's successful powerful and loyal. He also loves to party and not take life too seriously. Besides business what he does well with is woman. But what he is is very private. The last thing he should do is trust a reporter. 
 Rachel uses the pretense to interview Saint for one of his projects. Instantly Saint's taken with her as she doesn't fit his standard woman. She intrigues him. The more he gets to know her the more he wants to know. For the first time Saint wants more than just a play thing. 
 Rachel's instantly taken with the powerful Malcolm Saint so it doesn't come as surprise that she starts to get smitten with him. However crossing that line from expose to lover is a line that can't be uncrossed. 
 What is this? Am I a challenge to you now? His lips quirk. A challenge is something you stop wanting once you acquire it. I can't know if you're a challenge yet until I make you mine. 
 Rachel fights her attraction which only confuses her more. Which doesn't help because she's has some weird loyal pledge to her BFF that even confounds the issue more for her. 
 We're in the smart girls' closet where all the girls who never want to be brokenhearted go. Right? ... (insert eye roll here... come on Gina just because you got hurt doesn't mean you have to try and control your friends life) 
 Don't sleep with him Rachel not him (Dear Gina butt out! Why the hell does her BFF have so much power of her personal relationships?) 
 Maybe he was alone at the function but I bet he's not alone now Gina offers ... (Grrrrrrrrr not a fan of Gina) 
 Dear Gina ... 
 Normally I get mad at weak whiny heroines when they got hurt once wah and then they can't move on and continue to guard their hearts in case they ever get hurt again. But here is the clincher for me. Rachel hasn't even ever been heart broken by a boy before. Yes she lost her dad young but she's living this heartache vicariously through her friend. So she's protecting her heart because her friend got hurt. My thoughts to that are ... 
 Gina just having feelings for him makes me feel like I'm betraying me and you. We said we wouldn't do this. (What the ever loving fuck kind of pack is that?) 
 Argh! The loyalty to her friend's heartbreak is sweet in a way but really it's super annoying when the main heroine doesn't even know what heartache is so there's a lot of stress for this relationship for no real reason. :( 
 Let me tell you Saint totally won me over. He might have been a player but when he had the chance of real relationship he jumped on it turning his back to his manwhore ways. 
 It didn't seem right for you to spend another day without the luxury of a gift from a man who thinks of you. M.S. 
 I'm excellent at fooling around. I was made to fuck around. If anyone can tell the difference between fucking around and the real thing it's me. 
 Now that Rachel has stepped over the line and her heart is on the line all hell breaks loose when her dirty secret comes out. 
 Dear Rachel ... 
 Did you really think that was not going to blow up in your face? 
 And then after all this we're left with a cliffhanger. Noooooooooooooo! July 7th is when we will get to find out what happens after Rachel's epic screw up. Will she be able to save face? Will Saint go back to his own ways? I NEED TO KNOW!!!! Pre-Order Manwhore +1 Here: Amazon (CAN) | Amazon (US) 
 If it was just Saint he would get 5 stars! If it was for the couple I would give them 4 stars! But that damn Gina storyline drove me batty. I got it but I didn't respond to it which made me have mixed feelings for this book when I wouldn't have if it wasn't for her. So in the end even though there were parts that I LOVED I have to sadly give it a ...3.5 stars.

"4.5 Tragic Stars!! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Samhain Publishing via NetGalley 
 This is a spin off series from the Cost of Repairs series with some of the same characters being background characters. I haven't read the whole Cost of Repair series but now I think I need to. In this book we have Noel Carlson who is a young in the closet cop after a major gay bashing of him and his best friend. We also have Shane AKA as Jody McShane or AKA as Colby who is a young men with loads of secrets and burdens on his young soul which causes him to do anything to help him and his older brother out. 
 He learned to keep secrets because telling got him hurt. 
 Some of Shane's choices have caused him to need extra money so he starts to strip on the side which is where he meets the hunky cop Noel as Noel quickly gets him out a potentially bad situation. The connection is instant but they both have many secrets that can destroy them. 
 You're right though. I've never had a real relationship either. But I know enough to know that you don't end things in a fit of anger without talking about it. 
 This story had so much heartache and tragic parts that I was weeping for the last part of the book but it also had hope friendship and love. God! Poor Shane has lived with nothing but tragedy and is plagued with so much guilt and burden. But finally him and his brother get a glimmer of hope from their burdens even though it nearly kills Shane with his choices but then poor Shane gets hit with more tragedy that I could barely keep it together. 
 Thankfully even though it was a rocky road for them that he had Noel to help him through this very trying time. My fingers are crossed that Tristan will get a book maybe with Gabe????? Here's hoping.

"4 Checkered flag stars! 
 After the crazy cliffhanger in Fueled we don't know what to expect. What we didn't expect was Colton to forget the precious moments before the crash. 
 Rylee's beside herself with worry and heartache waiting for Colton to come back to her. Once he finally wakes up she's happy they can finally be together but Colton doesn't remember everything which only breaks her heart a bit more. 
 Their relationship is caustic and temperamental but it's also full of love and potential. Once Colton wakes up he knows what he wants but it's a tough to get to the other side. Gah! I knew KNEW his story was gut wrenching but finally hearing and reading the why guts you for the poor broken Colton. 
 Finally releasing that hold on him is the key to setting him free and being able to fully love. 
 ... life isn't about how you survive the storm but rather how you dance in the rain. 
 Their journey is a very rocky one but Colton knows his prize and its not winning racing but winning Rylee and what a way he wins her over forever. 
 I want to be your motherfucking checkered flag Rylee. Your pace care to lead you through tough times your pit stop when you need a break your start line your finish line your goddamn victory lane. 
 What a great epilogue and ending for these two. This story just got better and better."
"3.5 I spiderman you stars! 
 Usually in a series the first book is the best and the rest are not as good but with this series the books kept getting better and better. Colton's brokenness reminds me a bit of Remy from the Real Series by Katy Evans and god I felt no one could be more broken than that poor man but Colton looks like he may take the prize. 
 Throughout Fueled and Driven we are getting alluded to what could have been the catalyst to Colton's demise and you just KNOW that it is going to be heartwrenchingly terrible. 
 Gah! When Colton fucks up he fucks up! These two are a giant clusterfuck but yet so made for each other. Fueled is about them finding their way back to one another but they have to wade through quite the pile of shit to get there. 
 Colton's family knows he's broken but they love and cherish him anyways. For the first time they have hope because Colton's starting to change for the better and they know Rylee is the reason for this. 
 Colton is a wonderful yet complicated man ... worthy of your love even if he is unable to accept that concept yet. 
 Anxiety filled for a big part of this book while both of these stubborn asses figure their shit out. And then finally talk to one another instead of assume assume assume. Rylee's also to blame in their demise not just Colton. He knows what he could have and knows that he has to learn and compromise to be with Rylee. Now he just has to get her to listen which is a lot harder than need be. After finally get reamed out Rylee is forced to listen to Colton. Thankfully she really listened so she could open her heart to the possibility of more. 
 We're not broken baby ...we're just bent. And bent's okay. Bent means that we're just figuring things out."
"3 Rageful Stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of St. Martins Press via Netgalley 
 So I really liked the idea of the book and the content. The issue of rape and the aftermath is very delicate and relevant matter. Especially in the teen area where they are too young to deal with it logically. And with the power of social media it can turn into something uglier then it already is. 
 I liked this book but didn't love it as the writing style is not my favorite. I always connect and engage better when there is more dialogue than monolgue or inner dialogue. This book was a majority of inner dialogue which left me not connecting as much. Writing styles connect with different people. This is not my favorite but I know it will be for others. 
 However this is a book that I think all teenagers should read so they understand the potency of hurt caused by words and actions. It's kind of crazy to think when a girl says rape instead of supporting her they make her into the villian. With this it caused Romy to disconnect with reality and her family. After she's so lost she doesn't know who she is anymore or who she has become. All she does know is that she is a pariah in this small town instead of a rightful victim. 
 How she dealt with the aftermath was hard to see but I can't really judge that. As I have no idea at that age on how I would have dealt with it. Plus I'm such a big fan of HEA so I was really hoping that there would be a bigger one.

"3. 5 Grudge Holding stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Berkley | Penguin Group 
 Within the series we have come across Levi 'Painter' Brooks and Melanie Tucker but for the most part their relationship hasn't been pretty. Their hostile and angry. Now we get to see how they got to that point and if there is any hope for these two. 
 I have to admit it was nice to see that Melanie and Painter can be more 
 real instead of always explosive. 
 Well one thing we can say about Painter is he's honest and we know where we stand with him. He has never tried to be anything different then who he is. 
 Here's the ugly truth though he whispered. I'll want all of that-all of you-for 
 about a week. Then I'll get busy or bored or whatever and I'll stop 
 calling you. That's how I am Mel. I'm the guy who doesn't call and I 
 don't even regret it because I truly don't give a shit who I hurt. 
 Except for some fucked-up reason. I care about you. If some guy 
 treated you the way I dream about every night I'd kill him. I'm not 
 into suicide so that means we can't go there. Got it? 
 Even though Painter is honest he also wants more for Melanie then this MC life. However Melanie has different aspirations for a potential relationship with Painter. Now she just has to convince Painter that they should give this ago. 
 And take your fucking arm out from under my head. Cuddling is for closers. 
 I was so liking this book then Melanie really started to piss me off. She knew what she was getting into when she was pining over Painter for Christ sake she was writing him in prison. So Painter makes one mistake ONE admittedly a big one but it was still only one mistake. Then she takes stubborn to a whole new level. For years she won't listen to Painter and hear him out but she will reap the benefit of his MC. I get there were consequences to Painter's bad choices but he didn't have a lot of time to process the news which caused him to get immersed within his brotherhood. Unfortunately for both of them that decision had tons of blow back. 
 Mel I've done everything you've asked he said. And there's not a damned thing on earth I wouldn't do for Isabella. But I'm sick of jumping through your hoops only to have you go full bitch on me when I want to see my daughter. She's my kid too. 
 ~ 
 I fucked up. I know I fucked up I've apologized for it and I've done my best to make up for it. I'll never get that time with her back and I'll regret that for the rest of my fucking life. But no goddamned way I'll let you or anyone else get between me and my girl Mel. I appreciate all you've been through and I'm thankful that you're Izzy's mom but don't think you'll get rid of me. You'll never be rid of me Melanie. For the rest of your fucking life I'll be here because we share a kid. So stop being so nasty all the time. 
 ~ 
 Almost a year I've been free doing everything I can to help you. Financially around the house. I said something stupid when you told me about Izzy and then I got reckless. I paid for that by losing the first part of my daughter's life. I won't lose any more. I'm done trying to make you happy Mel so here's the new rules. You can fuck around all you want but you stay the hell out of my world. You come back inside I'm taking over. Got it? 
 Even though Melanie was a tool at times Painter changes the game so he can get his family back. Now all he has to do is wait. 
 New game Mel. I'm done riding bitch so you can feel good. Consider yourself warned. 
 I have to admit thankfully Painter has the MC because he was PATIENT with Mel's bullshit. If it was me I would have dropped her. Baby mamma or not. But when Painter loves he loves full out. However that doesn't mean he's being a saint while he's waiting. 
 Fuck but you hold a grudge. 
 Mel's grudge and BS were trying at times when reading this book but finally she effs up than Painter can take what he has always wanted. At the same time I was able to get back into the story instead of being frustrated with Mel's stubbornness. 
 If Mel were less stubborn I would have loved the book so much more. I know her hostility is what makes their relationship explosive and is a huge part of their dynamics but it got to be too much for me and started to alter my reading experience. 
 Did I love this book? Parts of it but it was more of the like quality for me. Did I like Painter? Yes even when he's being an asshole. Do I love the Reapers? Yes all of them and I can't wait for more from this series."
"5 Heartbreaking dark raw and beautiful stars!

 Genre: Adult Dark Romance 
 Part 3 in an ongoing seies 
 My Perfect Rage Review . . . 
 It has felt like for ever that I've been waiting for Connor's story and what a story it was. Perfect Rage is the third book within this series and it can't nor should it be read as a standalone. To truly find the break down of Connor all the books have to be read in order. 
 From the last two books we knew that Connor was broken but in Perfect Rage we get to see how truly broken he is and all that happened before he lived in his own personal hell. The before was us getting to truly fall in love with the before Connor. The man who had a hidden smirk and mischievous eyes but also a super loyal and protective heart. What first started as attraction turns into a deep forever love. 
 The moment Connor O'Neill meets Alina Diaz his world changed. At first for the better but then it turned for the worst. 
 Need to run faster than bullets shutterbug. 
 It didn't take long for these two to fall for each other but they were worlds apart. For Connor it was him being in the Military which is stressful enough but then you add the nightmare that Alina is running from and you know nothing good can come out of that. However for a brief moment in time they are able to carve out something beautiful and everlasting. 
 I've been with a lot of chicks Alina. I'm not proud of it but I don't regret it either. It means I also know when something is fuckin' special. And that was something fuckin' special. Not sure what to do with that. 
 However not all beautiful things are meant to last. And sometimes to protect the ones we love we have to sacrifice the most in order to save them. 
 In my world it's not if you love something set it free. It's if you love something don't let Carlos Moreno know. Carlos Moreno could never know I love Connor O'Neill. 
 The book starts in the past where we get to see Connor and Alina fall in love and then ends up present day with a very broken damaged Connor who's trying to survive after been held captive for years physically and mentally. 
 You love a man who's dead. That's not me now Alina. Maybe not. But whoever you've become you're still the man I love. You're still him and remembering what you've done is killing you. But you know why it is? Because you still have the good parts. If you didn't care none of the stuff you did while drugged would matter to you. 
 Often with the romance genre we fall in love with the almost unrepairable man but poor Connor takes the cake with his inner demons. Even though Connor is wading in a pool full of nightmares the one thing keeping his head out of water is his love for Alina. 
 I can't ever lose you again 
 I'm here Connor I whispered. I'm right here. 
 The unfortunate part is that Connor is now in a constant battle between whom he was and who he is now and everything he lost in between. 
 I'll try to get un-lost. 
 Connor is in a constant struggle but he's trying to come to grips with his new reality in order to keep Alina near by. 
 Babe I can't promise I'm always going to be here in the morning or hold you when you go to sleep. Fuck I want to and I'm trying but even if I need to leave I swear I'll always come back. . . . 
 Gah this story broke my heart with how Connor had to struggle with his demons that were weighing him down from any true happiness. Thankfully Alina was able to fight enough for the both of them. 
 I don't want perfect or the same. I just want us and whoever we are now 
 The more we watch Connor struggle the more my heart got heavy. You felt his pain and his struggles. 
 What I feel for her is limitless. There is no end to the love I have for her. 
 I can't even imagine what it would be like to have to battle what Connor had to go through but if you want something you have to fight to achieve it and what a fight it was for poor Connor. 
 Risk losing Connor. Risk losing everything. Because it it's limitless like you say then isn't it worth the risk? 
 I always love Nashoda's stories and she has given us another heartbreaking beautiful dark and raw love story. 
 I don't want it. I want him. Just him. 
 I absolutely love this series and the Tear Asunder series which is where this series evolved from. I loved this story and the trials and tribulations that Connor and Alina had to go through to get even a slice of happiness. There is so much more potential for this series and I can't wait for more from this series and anything by Nashoda Rose. 
 It's not easy to give up on someone you love. But that's not what this is Alina. This is being able to accept his choice. I don't know if it's the right or wrong one and I won't judge him for it. I didn't go through what he did."
"4 Witty & Sexy Stars!! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Gallery Books via NetGalley 
 Emma Chase has done it again with another fun witty book. This time we get inside the head of Stanton Shaw who happens to be a college friend of Drew Evans. 
 Stanton Shaw was from a small town USA where he meets his true love at a young age. After a teen pregnancy with his girlfriend Jenny Monroe he is committed to them. 
 ~ I see the top of the head pushing against my favorite place in the 
 whole world. It's bizarre and digusting but ... but kind of incredible 
 too. ~ 
 Jenny not wanting Stanton to lose out on what life could be encourages Stanton to follow his dream and go away to school. Even though he's away he is still committed to them in every way until he meets Drew Evans who dangles the forbidden fruit. 
 Dinner and a show-classic code words for 'alcohol and an orgasm.' 
 After this foray into what could be changes Stanton and his relationship with his daughter. Now they have an open relationship except when they are back home but one thing is for sure is that even though Stanton plays around he knows that Jenny is his end game. 
 Now Stanton is a uber successful lawyer living in DC. He's living his life to the extreme with a great career great friends and great sex. The game has now changed when Stanton gets an invitation to Jenny's wedding to someone else. Now he has to go home to change her mind but thinks he should bring home his current friends with benefits Sofia 
 Santos. Great Plan Stanton! We all know that this plan is going to blow up in his face. 
 You're so stubborn-you're so stuck on what you think is supposed to be that you're missin' what's right in front of you. 
 As Stanton tries to win Jenny back he starts to realize that he might have more feelings for Sofia then he originally thought. Oops! With this book we get dual POV's between Sofia and Stanton so we get to see how their relationship unfolds in its unconventional blindsiding manner. 
 ... It's an echo. Of who we were the promises we made 
 the passion we had. But an echo's not real-you can't build a life on 
 it. It's just a memory of a sound. 
 I love the way Emma Chase writes. It's engaging and fun. I quite liked this book but not as much as the Tangled series. Most likely because we knew this time what to expect from this style of writing. But it doesn't take away from it still being great. 
 Stanton and Sofia are great together and I liked the evolution of how they got there including all the mishaps and shenanigans along the way. 
 ~I am a man in love. Just not a man in love with Jenny Monroe.~ 
 Great book. Potentially great series. I can NOT wait for more. Fun witty book with loads of passion and love.

"4.5 Jake adoring Stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Gallery Books via NetGalley 
 Dear Emma Chase 
 This book was exactly what I needed. Lately I've been reading and liking them for the most part but I didn't know I needed more until I read Sustained. From the beginning of me starting this book I was annoying my husband with me reading it out loud so he too could enjoy the awesomeness of Emma Chase. I will admit that did back fire on me sometimes throughout the day. :) 
 Jake Becker . . .  hmmm what I can say about him. He's a loyal friend. He's a fierce lawyer. He's also a bit of a man whore with no desire to settle down. 
 You don't have to be an asshole. I shrug. I don't have to be . . . it's just easier that way. 
 After a imposed hiatus from sex due to a near mishap Jake starts to realize he wants more than just a quick lay but he also doesn't want commitment. He's game to start dating but doesn't really know how. 
 After running into a young boy who has a chip on his shoulder whom also reminds him of himself at that age. He goes to talk to his mom. Only to find out the real reason young Rory is so bitter. Meeting Chelsea McQuaid changes him instantly. But for a man who has never dated why go after someone who is a new guardian of six children? Easy because Chelsea's gorgeous and everything he never realized he wanted or needed in his life. 
 Jake tries to keep to his old ways but between those six hilarious kids and Chelsea they get under Jake's tough skin. 
 A knight in tarnished armor is still a knight. 
 Oh how the mighty fall. 
 Do you want me? . . . 
 All the time. I can't remember not wanting you anymore. 
 We all know that it was not going to be smooth sailing for one of Emma Chase's men and Jake is no exception to that. He makes some doozy errors but with nothing but good intent. He tries to fight it but can't especially when the kids get involved. 
 Don't worry about a thing. They've awoken a sleeping giant. And Jake is the scariest giant around. 
 Emma Chase is a genius at male POV's. I love being in the head of all her men. However with Jake it's even more. There is something so sweet and charming about this very loveable creature. I loved it! Everything about it. Definite recommend for this book this series and anything else by Emma Chase

"4.5 I totally Fell Stars!!! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy from Loveswept via NetGalley 
 God! What a sweet love story!!!!!! 
 I loved Matt from the get go. *swoon* The book starts basically with Matt getting hit by a football and falling instantly in love with a family. It is not your typical love story but it was amazing. I loved the fact that Matt saw past all the baggage of 4.5 kids and fell in love with all of them. 
 How long had it been since she'd been sheltered instead of being the shelterer? No one wanted to be strong all the time. 
 For Abby god she was so broken. Often I get frustrated with heroines who are whiny and insecure and there were moments where I was like 'Gah! Just pull your big girl panties up and move on' but then I had to step back and remind myself that Abby wasn't whiny and insecure she was just really broken which broke my heart. 
 Everything in life's a chance. Nothing is a sure thing. people die they leave they change. ... 
 Matt had his own demons but he knew what he wanted from the beginning and powered through to make it happen because he had to fight so many aspects for Abby to let go and fall where Matt would be to catch her. 
 This is a debut book by Claudia Connor and it rocked! I can NOT wait for Worth the Risk January can not come soon enough. This book was well written and captured me from the beginning. I was only going to read a few chapters before bed but I ended up staying up all night because I couldn't put it down having to find out how this story ended and what a sweet end it was. *sigh*

I was captured from the first moment until the end of this emotionally charged tale.

On her first night there she literally bumps into the one of the star baseball players who she is immediately smitten with but thinks he would only want to be friends with her. Thinking she has nothing to lose she jumps at the chance to make new friends. The last thing she wants is a relationship. 
 Nate has his own baggage but his heart is huge so when he runs into Rowe he knows he needs to get to know her. So he does everything in his power to bring her out of her shell so she can give him a shot at something more. The more Nate hangs out with Rowe the more she starts to blossom and open up. With the help of her roommate Cass and his brother Ty Rowe finally lets people in to her past. 
 And what a past it was. Yikes! I can't even imagine what it would be like in the aftermath of that tragedy. To add onto this tragedy Nate is put in the worst position that can potentially ruin everything. Even though I understood where she was coming from and I have never lived through what Rowe went through but at times I got so frustrated with her when the truth behind what Nate was hiding came out. Come on Nate is awesome and he was put into the shittiest situation with how to handle Rowe but she just couldn't let it go. Argh! Then finally she got her head out of her ass and started to move forward. Phew!! 
 This book was super sweet yet still filled with so much emotional angst that kept you reeled in to find out how it all plays out for this cute couple. I can't wait to read more from Ginger Scott and this series to find out about Ty and Cass.

"4 Second Chances don't always come easily 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Penguin Group 
 I Love this series! And I love second chance romances. Finally things are going smoothly for Jared and Ali but what about poor Christopher? When does he get his HEA? 
 In the first two books Chris goes through woman like there is a zombie apocalypse on the horizon and having sex is his only way to survive. We all knew it was a coping mechanism but we weren't sure what it was in regards to. 
 Now we finally get to realize that poor Christopher has had his heart broken when he was young and has never found anyone to replace that void even though he was looking. However the way he was going about was through hollow sex with no emotional connection. 
 Samantha has had one epic love of her life but it imploded to smithereens. For now she's content for settling because it feels safe where she can't get hurt any more 
 Now a chance meeting with Ali changes Sam's world. Ali has always wanted the best for Chris and she believes that Sam may be the ticket. So Ali may butt her nose in a bit for these two since they can't find their own peace without it. 
 The feelings have never subsided for these two but it doesn't always mean its right. However for Chris this time he won't let he go. For the whole book you know that their breakup was going to be from an epic miscommunication. A.L. Jackson has such a gift at keeping you reeled in just waiting for it all to unfold. Chris and Sam wade there way through back to each other but its not an easy journey. There's heartbreak and anxiety but its worth it in the end. But be warned to have some tissues ready for near the end as my heart literally wept at this part. Even though parts were heart wrenching they also help open up to the reality of what was going on. It helped everyone to move forward to find their slice of happiness and light.

 Part of a trilogy. It is recommended to read the other two first to get a deeper connection with Chessy and Tate. 
 4 Taken Stars!!! 
 My Taking It All Review... 
 Throughout this series I have been dying to find out what was happening to Chessy and Tate and now we finally get to see it all unfold. 
 I have always loved Chessy throughout the whole series as I did Joss. With Kylie oddly enough I liked her in the first and third book because she is a loyal kick ass friend but I didn't love her so much in her book. But with the guys I have absolutely loved Jensen and Dash but Tate has always been the unknown. 
 Here we find out why Tate is being an unbeknownst douche canoe. He only wants to take care of Chessy but his eye on the prize has become clouded and his has lost focus of what his prize is. 
 Chessy is too blame as well because she hasn't opened the lines of communication and acted like a doormat. So if she talked and Tate opened up his eyes then they would not have had so much heart ache. 
 Once the lines are finally opened after Tate's king of the assholes moments things start to look like things are back on track. The only thing they have to patch together is there Dom/sub relationship and things should be swimmingly. As Tate moves mountains to make his relationship first he does the unthinkable again and tops his worst moment with being an irresponsible Dom which is unfathomable in their world. 
 After this moment Chessy has no choice to leave. With this choice it blows Tate's world wide apart that he has to make changes or he will lose everything. As Tate and Chessy try to mend fences Kylie & Joss are finally getting their HEA's. 
 I have to admit this was my favorite of the series. Lately with Maya's books they have been hit or miss with me but I am glad to have a hit with this book and this series.

"4 Brilliant Stars!! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Atria Books via NetGalley 
 Wow! This was my first K.A. Tucker book 
 I know I know I have heard so many good things about K.A. Tucker and finally I got to read her brilliance. This book was a multiple POV with one POV being in the present while the other POV was in the past tying the whole story together. It's also about two souls being meant to be intertwined even though reality made it difficult fate still kicked ass for these two. 
 I always have a hard time reading when cheating is the theme but with this even though it wasn't the morally correct decision you were able to understand why they made the decisions they did. Jesse meets a stranger on the side of the road who changes his path in life with one random kiss. He later re-meets this stranger only to get caught in a morally changed tangled web leading to a case of amnesia and a chance of starting over. 
 The whole time I was biting my fingernails to find out how it all played out. I don't want to say too much about what happens in the book because I think it would would ruin the whole experience. I think it was brilliantly written yet a bit long. There were elements that I felt were drawn out too long and could have been shorter but all in all I did love it and I can NOT wait to read more from K.A. Tucker.

 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of TKA Distribution via NetGalley 
 I have heard nothing but great things about Nalini Singh with her Psy-changeling series so I jumped at the chance to read this but sadly this book fell flat for me. At times it was good & had great potential but the other times it was liking watching a bad corny B movie. 
 There was a rock star a virgin and a whole lotta sex with little substance. Molly is a shy librarian virgin who has lived through a media scandal and happens to be sisters to a PR person who represents one of the biggest up and coming bands. Molly gathers the attention from Fox and with her self doubts past and insecurities she wades through this new relationship after she gets deflowered about five minutes after officially meeting Fox. Heck what a better way to give up your V card than to a rock star with a reputation. 
 Fox is smitten and knows Molly is the one from the beginning all he has to do is convince her of that. Molly is not alone with her baggage but thankfully they can just screw each other constantly to find the rightness of each other. They have sex share their pasts have sex deal with mini drama after drama with sex intermingled in between and then have more sex have good moments with the band and life have sex oh let's add a little more past drama with no relevance than have some more sex then a touching sweet moment and then the end. 
 Gah! I wanted to like this so much more but sadly that was not the case.

 Standalone 
 My Black Lies Review ... 
 This book was dark twisted and brilliant. 
 After reading the synopsis which I found had a similar feel to Sex Love and Repeat I thought were going to get Sex Love and Repeat v2. However that was so NOT the case. What we got was nail biting what the hell is going OMG I so did not see that coming. Sometimes when I'm not sure what is going on I jump to the end to see what I am working towards (I know I know but I can't help it) but even after I did this I didn't have a hot clue. I had a suspicion but nothing concrete. 
 Alessandra Torre leans to the darker side of writing which is a nice reprieve from the happy go lucky contemporary romance. With her stories you never really know what you are going to get. So far with the books that I have read from her are a form of brilliant. 
 Black Lies is a book that needs to be experienced. You can't really summarize and review it without giving spoilers just know that it is going to blow your mind in one way or another. I was hooked from the first word to the very last. It is not your typical love story but a love story is what it was. I highly recommend this book!

"4 Sweet Stars! 
 eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Forever via NetGalley 
 I fell in love with this series with Perfect Kind of Broken so I could NOT wait to read this book and find out the reason behind Daren & Kayla's handcuff situation. 
 People are where our happiness is found. 
 Kayla has to come back to bury her dad who abandoned her many years earlier. She is doing this task out of duty not want. For Daren he is been let down and disappointed so many times from people who are supposed to care about him. All he knows of any kind of care are from him being a player and from Mr. Turner. 
 Daren is dealing with the loss of the only parental form he has ever known. With this loss comes a will with a very strange condition that for Kayla and Daren to get the money they have to be handcuffed together for the whole time until they find the money. 
 Kayla & Daren both have huge chips on their shoulders for good reasons but what they can't deny is the attraction and feelings between each other. 
 As Daren & Kayla go on this hunt to find the money they both so desperately need they also get to truly know each other and realize that it is ok to need a person and that not everyone is going to let them down. 
 Because money without love is complete poverty. And poverty with love well that's pure wealth. 
 This journey is so much more than a hunt for money. It's also about letting go finding truths and heartbreaking revelations for Daren & Kayla. This story was a sweet story about loss love hope and happiness. Daren & Kayla's journey was a emotional yet sweet excursion. At times I felt their chemistry and feelings a bit rushed but the desperation for love and support surpasses things making everything happen quicker than it normally would.

"3 Worth it Stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy from Loveswept via NetGalley 
 Ok I'll admit that I'm unfortunately still in my reading funk and sadly this book did not bring me out of it. I had my fingers crossed but it was a no go. I did like this book quite a lot but there were some elements that made me not love it. 
 We meet Slade and and Jessica in Against the Cage. There is where Slade was smitten with Jessica and kept asking her out but she was turning him down because she was in a relationship with a douchebag. After said douchebag crosses the line Slade comes in and saves the day to help take care of Jessica. For Jessica she has always been drawn to Slade but is skeptical because of his player ways. 
 Jessica means something different to Slade and he wants more but he's never really had a relationship so this is all new for him. With Jessica she loves being with Slade but because he means more to her than her past relationships her insecurity and jealousy sides make an appearance causing her to self sabotage her relationship a bit. 
 As Slade and Jessica move forward with their relationship their pasts make an re-appearance causing all kinds of turmoil for the two. Both are trying to do right by the other. But instead of communicating and trusting one another they make poor choices and act out causing them a world of pain. Now add some more poor choices and you get quite a mess between these two. But their pull is strong for one another so they have to fight in their own ways to get what they want from one another. 
 I liked the idea of the book and I did like the two main characters but the thing that held me off from loving it were a few things: 
 1) Slade was a supposed to be a dominant bad ass alpha and he was but ... it felt forced instead of natural. I can't quite put my finger on why it didn't feel natural but something was missing for me. 
 2) The endearment Lady. Ugh! I don't know why but that one makes me cringe instead of salivate. 
 3) I'm a stickler for details so I want to know how she was able to teach yoga. Jessica's degree is in exercise physiology but not specific in yoga and as far as I know they need to be certified to teach yoga. I know I know does that really matter in the scheme of things? No but it bothered me none the less. 
 4) Ok Jessica is forced to walk away and is moving back home in a few weeks but she's going on other dates? WTF???? Why? 
 5) After the epic emotional pivotal point in the book we get to see the true nature of Jessica's parents which was they were basically jerks then in about 10 seconds flat they completely change their ways. This turn over made me roll my eyes with the quickness of it which took away from the pivotal emotional angst. 
 Unfortunately my reading funk has made me a bit jaded and really nit picky with details lately but even though I did have some negative comments about specific details I did still like the book and I do adore Sidney Halston and I will be continuing with this series as the boys at WTF are growing on me.

"4 Storm Chasing Stars!!!! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review from Author Snow Queen Publishing and Literati Author Services 
 Genre: Adult Erotica Romance 
 My Breaking the Sky Review... 
 After loving the spiral of bliss series I jumped at the chance to read this story. The super strong Kelsey and the misunderstood brooding Archer. 
 I loved Kelsey in the first series but I have to admit I felt her quite weak in this book until the very end. It also drove me crazy that we didn't find out her reason for her walls until like 60% but then when we find out I felt it was a bit anti climatic. 
 As for Archer I knew he had some depth underneath his chip on his shoulder. Archer has made some bad choices but has finally seen the light to move forward and make better choices. 
 I loved Kelsey and Archer together. Once she finally stopped fighting it their chemistry was stormy and explosive. 
 This journey was also about the calm before and after the storm. That means fences were mended with Dean and past guilt was let go. So there now can be blue sky for this duo. 
 Once things got momentum it was a great story. It may have looked like opposites attract but in truth it was two very similar people needing each other just projecting their hurt in different armors. For Kelsy it was all about work and no fun. For Archer it was all about being the screw up everyone thinks he is and not striving for more. But for Archer he is so much more. Kelsey saw through his bullshit right away as well as Archer could cut through all of Kelsey's defenses so he could find the gem in the rough. 
 Again Nina Lane has written another erotic sexy tale with drama and angst.

"4.5 I freaking Love Crisis Stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Author & TRSOR Promotions via NetGalley 
 Finally fun loving easy going Crisis's story. I wasn't sure how Haven and Crisis were going to work but oh boy did they. 
 Haven is so broken and rightly so. Her past is so hard and heart wrenching. No one should have to live through that. But the thing is even though Haven has lived through a living nightmare she's still super strong. At first she portrays strong but in reality she is strong she just doesn't realize it yet. 
 You 
 will break. One day that cool exterior you're hiding behind will 
 shatter. It has to. It has nowhere to go. And when it does happen I 
 intend to be there to help you pick up the pieces. 
 With the help of Crisis Haven lets him slowly and surely. To the point that he gets under her skin and won't let go. Crisis may have been the player of the group but with Haven he's different. He wants more and he doesn't care that she comes with heaps of baggage. In truth he loves every part of her the good and the bad. 
 ~ That was what kept us alive. Our bond. I'd do anything from him just as he would for me.~ 
 Gah! Ream and Haven's sacrifices for one another are so heartbreaking. Haven's' still trying to be strong for Ream but that can only last for so long until she breaks. Thankfully Crisis is there to support her when that happens. Crisis was amazing from the way he's with his family to the way he loves wholeheartedly with no judgement. 
  . . . Your pieces may have scattered but they didn't break. 
 Tear Asunder and everyone associated with them can't seem to stay out of trouble. With Haven on the verge of breaking and her and Crisis becoming something more there's now a stalker on the loose with a a target of destroying Haven. Gah! Hasn't she had enough? 
 I LOVE THIS SERIES!! It's another dark yet beautiful series. Crisis has always been one of my favorites and he sure did NOT disappoint in this book. He's gentle and patient and kind. Which is exactly what Haven needs in order to open herself up and trust that things are going to be okay for the first time in her hard life.

"5 Darkly delicious 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Author via NetGalley 
 I Loved it. I wasn't sure about Kai from the bits we have seen of him in Torn From You (Tear Asunder #1) as well as from Perfect Chaos. He was so cold and calculated but wow what a sweet heart underneath that cold harsh exterior. 
 I belonged in the darkness and London belonged in the light. 
 My only downfall was the time lapse between me reading Perfect Chaos and The Tear asunder series was too long. It made some elements vague in my mind that I felt I was missing some pieces which could really effect the whole reading experience. If only I had more time then I would have re-read the Tear Asunder series (or at least Torn From You) and Perfect Chaos before so everything was fresh in my mind. Otherwise besides that detail I loved it. 
 Perfect Ruin reads parallel with the Tear Asunder series and Perfect Chaos then comes around to present time. We first meet Raven in Tear Asunder and know there is some sort of bond between her and the unfeeling killer whom is Kai but we don't have any details. Now we find out that Raven is really London and her and Kai have a history. A short one but a profound one. 
 Kai has been trained to be a cold hearted killer but the minute he sees London be super compassionate to others he knows she's different. What first starts as a job turns into a game changer for Kai. 
 I gotta admit if I had to live through what London had to endure I don't know how I would have survived. If only we all had a dark horse like Kai to help us pull ourselves back together. 
 No more running. You're going to have to be my braveheart in order to survive me. 
 This isn't just a dark romance its a dark suspenseful roller coaster through the ugly world of the Vault and the sexual underworld that no one should have to live through. Kai had no reason to want more but now that he does he will do anything to make it happen. 
  . . . but you find the good and you hold onto that because it's what will pull you both through the hell. I think Kai wants to be pulled out London. . . . 
 Gah! These two who seem so wrong and ruined in their own way but together they work perfectly. If it wasn't for each other I don't know if they would have survived. 
 It's just a word and I feel so much more than four fuckin' letters. But you need to hear it from me right now so I'm giving it to you. I love you London. 
 The unfeeling cold hearted Kai melts with the lightness honesty hope and love that London gives. Lately books have been more meh than yeah but this book was fantastic and I couldn't put it down. This is such a great series as well as the Tear Asunder series. They may be part of a darker world but the lightness and hope help to balance it all out. I can NOT wait for Connor's story."

 Since starting the Tear Asunder series I have been dying to read more about Deck and Georgie. And oh! boy did Deck not disappoint. However Georgie at times I wanted to wring her stubborn neck. 
 Georgie has always crushed on her older brother's best friend but the one thing that keeps them tied together is the worst thing ... the loss of her brother. After finding out she lost of brother when she needed Deck the most she went off the rails and a shit storm brewed in Georgie's young life. With decisions made and the return of Deck her world changes for good and bad. 
 Deck has always been protective of his best friend's little sister but he made a promise to his best friend and that was to protect her but also stay away from her. No matter what happens in Georgie's life Deck is there for her. Through all her antics he's solid and there but what he doesn't realize is that Georgie is holding a very big secret. Up to this point I was loving the story then .... with Georgie withholding the secret for sooooo long it was killing me. She was trying to protect Deck. What????? 
 And you think a threat like that would matter to me? 
 Exactly Deck. Your a bad ass why do you need protecting????? That was my question and I know the female brain isn't always the most logical and is more emotional than not as I am a female but this part dragged on a bit for me. Besides this little hiccup I did really like the story. It had tons of angst suspense drama and finally.... hot steamy love. Thank you Deck. Yummy Yummy! 
 Deck tried to do the right thing even with temptation repeatedly been thrown in the face but when the potential to lose Georgie out ways his promise he FINALLY gives in and then BAM all bets are off. As they get closer all the secrets come out from both sides and some of those secrets are quite the doozie. This book had me waiting on edge on many different elements: On them finally hooking up finding out her secret finding out his secret to finding out how their secrets mesh together and how it's all going to play out. I can NOT wait to read more from this series. I NEED to know what is going to happen with Kai and London and all tangled web we were left with.

 My girl Kathy demanded that I read this book so I could get my Alpha Male fix. I didn't know what to expect but I did know I was going to get me self another Alpha (My Favorite). In this book we have opposites attract. Suzy is the stick in the mud control freak where as City is the tattooed love em and leave em player. 
 As Suzy is stranded at the side of the road the most unlikely savior comes in the form of this tattooed bad boy. Even though Suzy may be a bit square her libido is a bit more lively and it can't deny its pull to City. 
 As for being owned I plan to own every inch of your body. You are mine sugar don't forget that shit. I'm going to fucking ruin you. 
 I did like this book and yes City was Alpha worthy but at times their relationship comes across as very juvenile which ended up making it hard for me to completely fall in love with the aspect of Suzy and City.

 eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Entangled Publishing (Brazen) 
 Finally we get to find out what has been happening behind the scenes with Logan and Sophie. 
 Sophie is the super shy woman who wants to re-invent herself but can Logan really be the answer to this transition. 
 Logan started his own business and loved it but lately the business has become to much and it doesn't know how to balance everything. Even though he is super busy he is also loyal so when his best friend ask for him to look out for his little sister. He said yes not realizing that Sophie was going to change his world in so many different ways. 
 This was my first Samanthe Beck Novel (insert gasp here) I know but after this it definitely won' t be my last. I have a few of her other books on my kindle that will be bumping there way up my TBR. 
 I thought this story was adorable with some heat. Sophie the shy misunderstood girl with kinky desires seems to pull in the most eligible groomsmen. I loved the idea of Sophie her insecurities got a bit much at times and took away from her character but Logan *sigh* he made up for her weakness. 
 Logan teaches Sophie to be herself and see the beauty that everyone else sees when they see her. With the love and acceptance of Logan Sophie shines which causes Logan to re-evaluate his needs and wants out of life. For the first time he wants more and makes it happen. 
 Great chemistry great story great series.

"3.5 Marco Loving Stars! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review from NAL 
 I flippin' love this series and I absolutely love Marco. I am a huge fan of the second chance love story but ..... I didn't love Hannah as much as I thought I was going to like her in this book. For the last three books Hannah has been kick ass but in this book how she dealt with everything in regards to Marco made be lose my love for her. 
 Hannah has always loved Marco but he breaks her heart so much that it is almost unrepairable. 
 After many years Marco unexpectedly comes back into her life and is determined to win her back and make up for all his mistakes. 
 [image error] 
 They both have secrets and one is ready to move forward where the other is too stuck within the pain of the past. 
 The thing I love most about this book was there was such a presence of the others : Braden and Joss Cam & Jo Cole Nate & Olivia and Ellie and Adam. If it weren't for them and all their support I don't know if I would have loved this book as much. Since this book is with Hannah grown up we get the fast forward of the lives of the On Dublin Street gang. (Which I absolutely loved reading) 
 Between the ever resilient Marco and the support of Hannah's family and friends she never would have gotten her stubborn hurt head out of her ass. The powerhouse in this book for me was Marco all the way. He made mistakes but he fixed himself and he tried to fix what he broke with nothing but love and support. 
 Samantha Young knows how to get to the heart of the matter and is brilliant at portraying relationship angst. Even though Hannah sadly wasn't one of my favorites I still love this series and I can't wait to read on with Cole.

 It has been awhile since I read a good hockey romance book and Sawyer Bennett once again did not disappoint. 
 Here we have Alex Crossman who let's be honest is quite an ass for a big chunk of the book. Don't get me wrong he has reason for it but he was still a douche. However even though he was a jerk you still can't help but love the misunderstood Alex. 
 Sutton Price was dealt a raw hand with her childhood but she chooses to make her past into a positive situation by being a teen drug counselor. Her life may have started bad but she ended up in a good scenario with her new step dad and half brother. This family was so sweet humble grateful and balanced. The didn't take anything for granted and they all wore their hearts on their sleeves. 
 The team has had enough with Alex's asshole ways so they force him to work with Sutton on a teen campaign. This immediatley throws the two together. Sutton doesn't cower to Alex which sparks life and light into Alex making him want to be more for the first time ever. 
 Sutton knows absolutely nothing about hockey which helps re-ignite Alex's first love of hockey instead of always been stuck in the negative mode he seems to operate within. Both have their personal baggage but choose to deal with it differently. Thankfully Sutton brings out the softer super sweet side of Alex where we get to all fall in love with him. 
 Alex and Sutton have their woes but fight throughout to find their HEA. I did adore this book and as always Sawyer as produced yet another great book. I can't wait for more from these Cold Fury men and this series.

 As you all know I have been in the longest reading funk and the heroines are whiny insecure and annoying but I thought maybe Renee Carlino could pull me out with her brilliance and she almost did until the end which then I wanted to chuck out my kindle with my frustrations. 
 First the way the book was set up was brilliant and so well done. Due to my funk I had to constantly remind myself that Avelina was truly legitimately broken with her past. At times my frustrations slipped than I would reprimand myself and get back on track with loving this story. 
 Avelina has had a shit life and at a time in her life where she's really just beginning to emotionally develop into adult hood. Since she has so much tragedies she's a bit stunted and insecure as well as just plain stuck not knowing how to get out of her own personal hell. 
 For Nate he's living on top of the world but quickly realizes how unbalanced his world outside of work is until he loses a patient. A forced sabbatical and a sad melancholy girl changes everything for him. 
 As Nate meets Avelina he slowly works his way in her heart to build some sort of future but both of their pasts are causing trouble which makes Avelina to run again. Now that Nate has learned a few things he fights for what he wants and chases after her. Up until here I was super happy with the book besides the small detail that I could have missed this part but I didn't hear of any birth control at all so I don't know how they didn't get pregnant and cause more turmoil. But then Avelina decides she has to grow as an individual which I totally understand and support but her choice on how to execute it. ARGH!!!!!!! 
 Now for the next part of the book I was all 
 to then... 
 to finally settle down to happy but with this little frustration it definitely put me back into the funk. 
  ... You proved to me how strong you are and how much you want us to be together. I'll never ask for proof again. Now I can trust you and I hope you can trust me too. 
 In real life there is no way a strong independent man would be okay with her choice. Nope no way. Thus my frustration. That test to prove his trust was brutal and made me ANGRY. Gah I was so close to coming out of my funk. Grrrrrr! I was so sad with this part of the book because I until than I thought it was brilliant as everything else Renee Carlino writes. She encaptures so much emotions with her stories that it is why I adore her. Sure this one also had me emotionally charged and yes frustration is an emotion as well but I don't think that was the emotion she was going for at this part of the book. I'm sure it was worse because of my reading funk which has left me in a more negative reading frame of mind but sadly this little turn around changed my overall view of the book for me.

 Gah! I love this series!!!!!!! From the first book to the last it had me reeled in. There's so much suspense intrigue drama as well as loads of passion and chemistry in these books. 
 Total Surrender is the last and final book of the Sin Brothers series and we finally get to find out about Jory. For the last three books there has been speculation that Jory is still alive while the other Dean brothers fight tooth and nail for each other and their new loves.

 Two years ago Jory was shot and left in a coma. Now that he's out he has to finish his promise and live for his brothers so he can save them before he dies. After being shot the chip went offline leaving either a miracle to fix it or death for poor Jory.

 Instantly she's drawn to Jory but knows not to trust him with the information she has received from her father. And especially since Jory's story doesn't match up to what she has been told. The more she tries to do her job the more she gets drawn into Jory and starts to doubt everything. 
 As Jory gets the chance to escape he takes Piper. With one hot kiss on the run everything changes for these two. Now torn between the new possibility of Jory and the loyalty to her father Piper doesn't know where to turn or where to go. 
 Time to make a choice sweetheart. Please. Choose me.

Now that they're together things should go easier but it never does for these brothers. Not only are they fighting the clock but now they are also having to save their brothers and their new family.

 Never Alone. 
 This series is amazing. I highly recommend it. It is filled with so much that you can't put these books down. Rebecca Zanetti is one of my favorites and she has done another amazing job with this book.

"3.5 Promising Stars!! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Penguin 
 Here we have the fourth book in this NA series. Nate has been the 'player' friend and cousin to Kai whom has been in the background of the last three books. Here we finally get to find out his story. There is something sweet about this series but something about this story wasn't reeling me in. I liked the premise and the characters but I was able to put it down frequently and move on. However I wanted to finish it so I forced myself to finish it and I did like it in the end but ... it was not my favorite in the series. 
 Nate has desires he is ashamed of especially been brought up by an abusive father and a dysfunctional family. His biggest fear is that he will end of like his father so to prevent that he never connects with the woman he sleeps with. He doesn't kiss them and he does not do repeats. One thing he does have is his friendship with Jesse which is his constant but when Jesse walks in on him in the public bathroom with a hook up everything changes. For Jessie she stats to see a side of Nate that she didn't think belonged to the straight laced Nate which instantly intrigues her and her libido. Jesse has suffered loss of her father but she was raised from a great loving supportive family. 
 Everyone ... has a hidden part of themselves ... they don't allow anyone to see 
 Jesse is a tattooed girl who knows what she wants and who she is. So she can see the struggle that Nate is going through. After Nate literally gets caught with his pants down he starts to regret his choices. As Jesse needs Nate to help her with a school project it forces them together. Their chemistry is strong and there physical connection is instant but Nate's internal battle is stronger. Jesse helps tame and balance Nate's struggles. Jesse doesn't know what to do for Nate but her heart is involved. Nate wants to be with Jesse but his head is effed up so with the help of a counsellor he's able to start to move on and help his splintered family heal. 
 You had some experience growing up and it ... left a bruise on your heart.  
 The more Nate confronts his past the more he's able to deal with his internal desires and battles from within. Jesse wants the whole of Nate the assertiveness the dirty talker the sweetheart the whole thing. As I was reading it I did like the story as I previously stated but I will admit I got tired of Nate's internal battle and I just wanted him to move the eff on and deal with it. Thankfully he got his head out of his ass and realized that maybe he can have darker impulses and not be an asshole like his father.

"3.5 Cole Loving Stars!!! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy from Penguin/NAL 
 I really do love this series and I have been dying for Cole's story. I have to admit I was surprised that it was not from Cole's POV but it totally worked from Shannon's. Cole has always had a piece of my heart since we first meet him as a 14 year old boy. He was so shy loyal and sweet and he turned out to be such an amazing beautiful man. 
 Cole and Shannon have a brief meeting when they are 15 but don't meet again for another 9 years. In that time Shannon has dated douchebag after douchebag causing a rift in her brutal family. For Cole he as always been searching for the one that he can love forever. *sigh* Even though he may look like a tattooed bad ass player he is anything but. 
 Since Shannon has constantly been burnt with her bad choices she immediately judges Cole's character. Which causes quite the animosity between the two. Once she gets to know Cole's family & friends she quickly learns that she may have made a bad error in her judgement call. 
 Once she realizes that Cole is not anything like her loser exes she gives him a chance and their love blossoms and she starts to heal and regain her self worth that she has lost with her past choices. 
 Even though her family sucks ball excluding Logan (who is awesome and I can't wait for his story.:}) She makes a promise to her brother to try to mend the gap of her family but doing this she potentially can lose the best thing that has ever happened to her. 
 I couldn't believe what she'd said to me. I didn't even know what I'd done to deserve it. 
 (Come on Shannon!!! What a daft twat! She was so woe is me that she couldn't tell this difference from her head from her ass at this point. I will admit there were times I wanted to choke hold the stupidity out of her or yank her head out of her ass) 
 Once again Shannon was ignorant to her choices and opens her big mouth causing all kinds of pain for Cole but thankfully Logan sets her straight. 
 Throughout the book I loved Cole and I was so happy to see him get what he deserves which is true happiness and feeling of wholeness. Great series! Great Story. Thankfully we get to see the whole tribe in this story as well You can never get enough of Braden Cam or Nate. :)

"eARC for Honest Review from Flirt via NetGalley 
 Well this is the first snowboarder book I have read. It had the elements that I like. Zee -Male Lead gorgeous broken with loads of tattoos and baggage. Ophelia - Female Lead with baggage as well but a strong character. 
 Zee is the typical womanizer on the mountain and can everyone he wants until he meets Ophelia. Ophelia has her own demons and doesn't seem interested in Zee which only makes him want her more. 
 As Zee pursues Ophelia he starts to feel more for her than he has ever felt. It is coming to the anniversary to one of the worst moments of his life and all his demons are coming at full force but this year he is able to deal with them with the help of his friends and his new found relationship with Ophelia. 
 Ophelia is drawn to Zee but has already barely lived through one extreme risk male and doesn't want to go through the same thing twice but there is something different with Zee. 
 Zee and Ophelia are good together. With each other they are forced to help each other deal with their past together and move forward. 
 I liked the way Zee and Ophelia ended but holy shit the ending WTF now I have to read the next book to find out what happens. Tracy Wolff was quite the trickster there with her ending forcing me to be hooked onto this series which is kind of ironic since the book was a slow start with me but by the end I was hooked into it and now I am hooked into the series.

"3 Fraying Stars!!! 
 Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of NAL Trade 
 I am an absolute fan of this series but I sadly have to say that I did not care for this book as much as the others. I think after reading Blurred it was over redundant with Ben. I did start to like Ben in Blurred but I found Frayed was just a longer version of Blurred with the addition of Bell's POV. 
 I did like Bell in the previous books even though she was a bit too sheltered from her family but she had many qualities that had potential and Kim Karr did a good lead into Bell's life with the other books tying in with this book but this book ended up still falling flat for me. 
 As we start to read this I have to admit that Bell's hot and cold mood swings and her secret holding got a bit old for me. Plus she was holding a grunge on Ben when she pursued him knowing he had a girlfriend at the time plus he didn't even know her secret that caused her so much pain so I didn't see how that was fair (Hmmm I guess I'm turning Team Ben here... who knew). 
 I don't know if I'm reading too many books which is started to get me jaded or what but lately the story lines of pure assumptions where she thinks he is with someone else and vice versa are driving me batty. I want more from books than this story line and the gem of miscommunication. I do still like Kim Karr and I did like this book I just didn't love it as much as the others. This rant is really just a rant but unfortunately this book is what through me over my edge as I have just read it too many times. 
 I know I was reading the ARC version so many of the errors may have been fixed with more editing but it was hard to read for me because one of the things I adored most about Kim Karr's books was her genius way at organizing all the details of her tangled web of all the characters but this book had many time line and wrong name errors that it threw me. I hope it is the case of not the final edit not the case of too many details have finally gotten to hard to keep on top of. 
 Even though this was not my favorite of the series I can't wait to find out the secret behind Caleb.

 Finally I have been in a reading funk lately with being bombarded with similar plots formulas and story lines but this little number shook me out of it. It was different with an air of mystery and suspense in the background but still had a great love story. 
 Here we have Dahlia who has lived through a lot of sadness and loss but one constant she always had was Ben who also happened to be the love of her life. With Ben they have a huge once in a lifetime love being friends since they were kids growing into lovers and on their way to getting married....then the unthinkable happens and she has to live through another HUGE loss. 
 When Dahlia was still with Ben she had a girls night out and during this night out with her best friend she meets a singer named River from a band who she is instantly drawn too but she does the right thing and goes back to her boyfriend and pushes thoughts of this singer to the back of her mind. 
 ...All I know is I was a young college girl who flirted with an insanely attractive guy at a bar and had to leave because she felt like the cosmic universe had crashed down on her. And she couldn't accept that she had a boyfriend. 
 Dahlia is having a hard time with the loss of Ben but with time and the support of her friends she is able to finally move on and start living again. Her first real step out into the world she runs right back into River from years gone past and their connection is as strong as ever. 
 River and Dahlia make up for lost time and their connection does nothing but grow and cements the two of them together. Dahlia has a hard time with this since these feelings are so new different and stronger than she had with Ben but since Ben is gone she has to let go and move forward with River. 
 Now this love story is all and good and I adore it but the awesome part through the whole book is the undercurrents of secrets that you know are going to cause a world of shit for these two. There are so many elements that are going to be pulled together I assume in the next few books that can either strengthen or break River and Dahlia. But let me tell you that epilogue HOLY SHIT!!! SO was not what I expected but I LOVED that twist and I can NOT WAIT to read TORN to find out what happens with this new twist and how they play out with all the other undercurrents. 
 This books is a must read for me and I can't wait to read more from the series.

"4.5 So Sweet Stars! 
 eARC for Honest Review Courtesy from Author and Wordsmith Publicity 
 First lets just start with the fact that I flat out Love Jessica Park and this series. I fell in love with Celeste in Flat Out Love and again in Flat Out Matt and I was so happy to get to see the in-depth version of Celeste. 
 Finally getting to know Celeste caused me a whole gamut of emotions. You heart breaks for her and all her intricacies but what is so special about Celeste is those are also what makes you love her so much more. 
 As Celeste is trying to find her place in this world she stumbles across Justin who happens to be just as quirky and enduring as Celeste. On their own they are specially fantastic but together they melt my heart with how right they are together. 
 Celeste has always been able to count on her brother Matt but she is saddened with his heartbreak with not being with Julie anymore (*gasp!!!!). Celeste has never really experienced any kind of romantic relationship before but now that she is starting to experience this type of joy she wants Julie & Matt to re-experience as well. For it only to blow up in her face. 
 Celeste knows she is different but can't accept that people would be okay with that prospect so she pushes away everyone so she can't hurt anyone or be hurt in return. This also causes more angst but also healing as she is forced to finally let go of her heartbreaking pain with the loss of Finn. But Celeste is not the only one who has to heal so that they can move forward and learn to love and accept being loved forever. 
 This was such a heartbreakingly sweet story that I absolutely adored. It was so well written and Jessica was able to capture all of Celeste and Justin's enduring personality quirks so magically that you couldn't do anything but fall in love with them and of course Matt & Julie as well. Loved it!

 I have to admit I wasn't sure about this book from the synopsis but what sold me was it was a Kindle Alexander book so I had to read it and the outcome was.....I loved it! 
 Right from the first chapter I was crying and was hook line and sinker with Avery and Kane. After I was hooked in then we got to reminisce and find out how Kane and Avery came together. 
 Some may think this book at bit sappy but not for me I loved it and it was exactly what I needed in my long book drought. 
 This book was brilliant. A beautiful love story about love that lasts forever. 
 This story was a love story showing it from the end to the beginning and back again. It was a journey about one man who was supposed to keep his secret to better his career and another man who was conflicted emotionally from his Christian upbringing but together they fought for their love and their HEA and overcame so much. 
 I don't want to say too much because you just need to experience the love story of Kane and Avery yourself. 
 As always Kindle Alexander has done it again with a beautifully told MM love story.

 Genre: NA Contemporary Romance 
 Part 4 in a series but could be read as a standalone but recommended to read the series as a whole 
 My Shatter Review ... 
 When I first started to read this I was starting to think that it was going to be similar to the last couple of books in the series but I was pleasantly surprised for this book to be a bit different compared to the others. There was still angst and insecurites but Darwin/Jonathon was not a tattooed uber alpha he was a super sexy yet quirky chemistry genius. I was digging this book until about the 90% mark when I wanted to bitch slap Kylie for all her insecurities. I'm not trying to be harsh but there comes a point when you want the insecure heroine to just pull up her big girl panties and get over herself. 
 Luckily Kylie got her shit together or I would have been pissed. This was not your typical romance where it things all rainbows and unicorns and love at first sight. For Kylie she is getting over her Nate the douche canoe of an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart and cheated on her. With all the emotional turmoil it starts to effect her school which causes her to need a tutor .... enter Darwin/Jonathon. 
 While Darwin helps her with chemistry he also helps her with a night of good loving to help her feel better about herself and to get over her ex. What they didn't expect was for science to make a breakthrough. They were both content with this one night stand until Kylie has to tell Darwin/Jonathon that they are pregnant. I must say he takes the news rather well and with this new pregnancy they decide to give dating a try which is a bit backwards but worked until tragedy happens and Kylie's insecurities overpower her. 
 I think Erin McCarthy rocked the dual POV's and captured Darwin to perfection. I adored everything about him. It was a quirky angsty romance with many ups and downs but still super sweet as the rest of the series. I believe this is the last of the series and if that is the case it ended well. Sweet story minus the insecurities overload but all in all I adore this book and this NA series.

"3.5 Bad for You Stars!!! 
 Mini Review ... 
 Finally Krit's story. For so long I have been wondering what the story behind Krit is and now we get to find out. Krit has been a player for almost too long but doesn't think he deserves love. So it's just easier to sleep with them and discard them. Once Krit thought he was in love but truthfully he was more in love with the idea of being in love because he and Jess were cut from the same cloth. 
 Problem with that love is that you're really fucking hard not to notice 
 Blythe knows a truth that she has been told which is that she is ugly dark and evil. Due to this she doesn't get close to people because they will see her. ????? What the what??? 
 You don't just fit into my world Blythe. You are my world 
 After seeing Blythe's demons Krit has to fight for their love but it's worth it in the end. Cute Series Good NA Book.

"Scarlett is a girl and farmer living in a small town in France. Her grandmother who has raised her has disappeared and Scarlet believes that she has been kidnapped. The police have stopped looking and she's desperate to find some sort of clue. When she finds her father at her farm looking for something to give the kidnappers she finds out that he was also taken and tortured but her grandma refused to give them what they wanted so they release them. When she questions him about their captors all he knows is that they have weird tattoos. She recalls a guy with a similar tattoo named Wolf a street fighter that helped her earlier that day. He tells her he was part of a gang that is trying to find information about Princess Selene and that they've taken her grandmother because she was a pilot that went to the moon just before the attack on the princess. She asks him to take her to Paris to find the gang and rescue her grandma and Wolf decides to help her. Meanwhile Cinder escapes with the help of another convict named Thorne and now they have a ship and can travel to Africa to find Dr. Erland. She's scared and she wants answers so she decides to find a pilot in France that may have the answers about how she came to Earth and what happened to her in her first years. 
 I liked Scarlet as a character and I also liked Thorne Cinder and Kai. Having their point of views was fun and made the book more fast paced. Wolf was ok I wasn't a big fan most of the time but I don't dislike him. I loved how strong and determined Scarlet was and how she didn't get side tracked for anything. Her priority was finding her grandma. 
 The development was predictable because we know Red Riding Hood's story. (view spoiler)[ Wolf betraying Scarlet her grandma dying. I didn't expect him to work for the Lunar Empire but it was obvious there was something supernatural about him and his gang and the fact that Scarlet doesn't get suspicious was disappointing. It sucks that they also killed her father she didn't get to reconcile with him or at least forgive him. (hide spoiler)] 
 You can see how Cinder is struggling with her destiny and duty how she wants to know more about herself but is terrified about her role. 
 It was also fun to see how Cinder's and Scarlet's story connect and by the end of the book they've formed this wanted/saving the world team (or pack). Can't wait to see what happens next and what Erland has planned for Cinder!"
"Nyx has been born and raised to marry a demon. Her whole life she was treated as a weapon never loved by her family. She resents her father who made the bargain and is cold with her her aunt who instructs her and sleeps with her father and twin sister the one chosen to live. 
 But when she meets Ignifez he's different that what she imagined. She knows she has to follow her father's plan and try to end the curse that has fallen in the island but she discovers that the curse may not be as simple as she imagined. 
 I really liked this book. At first it reminded me Uprooted but at the end I felt it really similar to Wintersong. I didn't love it as much as the first but I enjoyed it more than the last. It captivated me and it was enchanting and sweet. I could feel like it was a retelling of the Beauty and the Beast but at the same time it was really different with its own mythology and plot twists. 
 I loved Ignifex but I wish we could get to know him more. At times he felt a bit flat. Shade was a great character and the same can be said about Astraia but I wish we could see a bit more about her true personality. 
 And Nyx... I loved her too. She is strong but full of anger and is one of the darkest characters I've read in a YA story. Definitely the first that (view spoiler)[ betrays her lover willingly (hide spoiler)]. 
 I loved the ending it felt right and perfect. (view spoiler)[ Ignifex being one with Shade and being the last prince and sacrificing himself for his kingdom was perfect. It was bittersweet that reality changed and still Nyx's mother died but in this new time she had a great relationship with her sister and a better one with her father and aunt and at the end gets to save Lux.
